<h1 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 3em;">ONLY A GIRL'S LOVE.</h1>

<p class="ph2" style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</a></p>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is a warm evening in early Summer; the sun is setting behind
a long range of fir and yew-clad hills, at the feet of which
twists in and out, as it follows their curves, a placid, peaceful
river. Opposite these hills, and running beside the river, are
long-stretching meadows, brilliantly green with fresh-springing
grass, and gorgeously yellow with newly-opened buttercups.
Above, the sunset sky gleams and glows with fiery red and
rich deep chromes. And London is almost within sight.</p>

<p>It is a beautiful scene, such as one sees only in this England
of ours&mdash;a scene that defies poet and painter. At this very moment
it is defying one of the latter genus; for in a room of a
low-browed, thatched-roofed cottage which stood on the margin
of the meadow, James Etheridge sat beside his easel, his eyes
fixed on the picture framed in the open window, his brush and
mahl-stick drooping in his idle hand.</p>

<p>Unconsciously he, the painter, made a picture worthy of
study. Tall, thin, delicately made, with pale face crowned and
set in softly-flowing white hair, with gentle, dreamy eyes ever
seeking the infinite and unknown, he looked like one of those
figures which the old Florentine artists used to love to put upon
their canvases, and which when one sees even now makes one
strangely sad and thoughtful.</p>

<p>The room was a fitting frame for the human subject; it was a
true painter's studio&mdash;untidy, disordered, and picturesque. Finished
and unfinished pictures hung or leant against the walls,
suits of armor, antique weapons, strange costumes littered the
floor or hung limply over mediæval chairs; books, some in bindings
which would have made the mouth of a connoisseur water,
lay open upon the table or were piled in a distant corner.
And over all silence&mdash;unbroken save by the sound of the water
rushing over the weir, or the birds which flitted by the open
window&mdash;reigned supreme.</p>

<p>The old man sat for some time listening to Nature's music, and
lost in dreamy admiration of her loveliness, until the striking of
the church clock floated from the village behind the house; then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
with a start, he rose, took up his brushes, and turned again to
the easel. An hour passed, and still he worked, the picture
growing beneath the thin, skillful hand; the birds sank into
silence, the red faded slowly from the sky, and night unfolded
its dark mantle ready to let it fall upon the workaday world.</p>

<p>Silence so profound took to itself the likeness of loneliness;
perhaps the old man felt it so, for as he glanced at the waning
light and lay his brush down, he put his hand to his brow and
sighed. Then he turned the picture on the easel, made his way
with some little difficulty, owing to the litter, across the room,
found and lit an old briar-wood pipe, and dropping into the chair
again, fixed his eyes upon the scene, and fell into the dreamy
state which was habitual with him.</p>

<p>So lost in purposeless memory was he, that the opening of the
door failed to rouse him.</p>

<p>It was opened very gently and slowly, and as slowly and noiselessly
a young girl, after pausing a moment at the threshold,
stepped into the room, and stood looking round her and at the
motionless figure in the chair by the window.</p>

<p>She stood for full a minute, her hand still holding the handle
of the door, as if she were not certain of her welcome&mdash;as if the
room were strange to her, then, with a little hurried pressure of
her hand to her bosom, she moved toward the window.</p>

<p>As she did so her foot struck against a piece of armor, and
the noise aroused the old man and caused him to look round.</p>

<p>With a start he gazed at the girl as if impressed with the idea
that she must be something unsubstantial and visionary&mdash;some
embodiment of his evening dreams, and so he sat looking at her,
his artist eye taking in the lithe, graceful figure, the beautiful
face, with its dark eyes and long, sweeping lashes, its clearly
penciled brows, and soft, mobile lips, in rapt absorption.</p>

<p>It is possible that if she had turned and left him, never to
have crossed into his life again, he would have sunk back into
dreamland, and to the end of his days have regarded her as unreal
and visionary; but, with a subtle, graceful movement, the
girl threaded the maze of litter and disorder and stood beside
him.</p>

<p>He, still looking up, saw that the beautiful eyes were dim,
that the exquisitely curved lips were quivering with some intense
emotion, and suddenly there broke upon the silence a low,
sweet voice:</p>

<p>"Are you James Etheridge?"</p>

<p>The artist started. It was not the words, but the tone&mdash;the
voice that startled him, and for a brief second he was still dumb,
then he rose, and looking at her with faint, trembling questioning,
he answered:</p>

<p>"Yes, that is my name. I am James Etheridge."</p>

<p>Her lips quivered again, but still, quietly and simply, she
said:</p>

<p>"You do not know me? I am Stella&mdash;your niece, Stella."</p>

<p>The old man threw up his head and stared at her, and she saw
that he trembled.</p>

<p>"Stella&mdash;my niece&mdash;Harold's child!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," she said, in a low voice, "I am Stella."</p>

<p>"But, merciful Heaven!" he exclaimed, with agitation, "how
did you come here? Why&mdash;I thought you were at the school
there in Florence&mdash;why&mdash;have you come here alone?"</p>

<p>Her eyes wandered from his face to the exquisite scene beyond,
and at that moment her look was strangely like his own.</p>

<p>"Yes, I came alone, uncle," she said.</p>

<p>"Merciful Heaven!" he murmured again, sinking into his
chair. "But why&mdash;why?"</p>

<p>The question is not unkindly put, full, rather, of a troubled
perplexity and bewilderment.</p>

<p>Stella's eyes returned to his face.</p>

<p>"I was unhappy, uncle," she said, simply.</p>

<p>"Unhappy!" he echoed, gently&mdash;"unhappy! My child, you
are too young to know what the word means. Tell me"&mdash;and
he put his long white hand on her arm.</p>

<p>The touch was the one thing needed to draw them together.
With a sudden, yet not abrupt movement, she slid down at his
side and leant her head on his arm.</p>

<p>"Yes, I was very unhappy, uncle. They were hard and unkind.
They meant well perhaps, but it was not to be borne.
And then&mdash;then, after papa died, it was so lonely, so lonely.
There was no one&mdash;no one to care for me&mdash;to care whether one
lived or died. Uncle, I bore it as long as I could, and then I&mdash;came."</p>

<p>The old man's eyes grew dim, and his hand rose gently to her
head, and smoothed the rich, silky hair.</p>

<p>"Poor child! poor child!" he murmured, dreamily, looking
not at her, but at the gloaming outside.</p>

<p>"As long as I could, uncle, until I felt that I must run away,
or go mad, or die. Then I remembered you, I had never seen
you, but I remembered that you were papa's brother, and that,
being of the same blood, you must be good, and kind, and true;
and so I resolved to come to you."</p>

<p>His hand trembled on her head, but he was silent for a moment;
then he said, in a low voice:</p>

<p>"Why did you not write?"</p>

<p>A smile crossed the girl's face.</p>

<p>"Because they would not permit us to write, excepting under
their dictation."</p>

<p>He started, and a fiery light flashed from the gentle, dreamy
eyes.</p>

<p>"No letters were allowed to leave the school unless the principals
had read them. We were never out alone, or I would have
posted a letter unknown to them. No, I could not write, or I
would have done so, and&mdash;and&mdash;waited."</p>

<p>"You would not have waited long, my child," he murmured.</p>

<p>She threw back her head and kissed his hand. It was a strange
gesture, more foreign than English, full of the impulsive gracefulness
of the passionate South in which she had been born and
bred; it moved the old man strangely, and he drew her still
closer to him as he whispered&mdash;</p>

<p>"Go on!&mdash;go on!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well I made up my mind to run away," she continued. "It
was a dreadful thing to do, because if I had been caught and
brought back, they would have&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop, stop!" he broke in with passionate dread. "Why did
I not know of this? How did Harold come to send you there?
Great Heaven! a young tender girl! Can Heaven permit it?"</p>

<p>"Heaven permits strange things, uncle," said the girl, gravely.
"Papa did not know, just as you did not know. It was an
English school, and all was fair and pleasant outside&mdash;outside!
Well the night just after I had received the money you used to
send me each quarter, I bribed one of the servants to leave the
door open and ran away. I knew the road to the coast and
knew what day and time the boat started. I caught it and
reached London. There was just enough money to pay the fare
down here, and I&mdash;I&mdash;that is all, uncle."</p>

<p>"All?" he murmured. "A young, tender child!"</p>

<p>"And are you not angry?" she asked, looking up into his face.
"You will not send me back?"</p>

<p>"Angry! Send you back! My child, do you think if I had
known, if I could have imagined that you were not well treated,
that you were not happy, that I would have permitted you to
remain a day, an hour longer than I could have helped? Your
letters always spoke of your contentment and happiness."</p>

<p>She smiled.</p>

<p>"Remember, they were written with someone looking over my
shoulder."</p>

<p>Something like an imprecation, surely the first that he had
uttered for many a long year, was smothered on the gentle
lips.</p>

<p>"I could not know that&mdash;I could not know that, Stella! Your
father thought it best&mdash;I have his last letter. My child, do not
cry&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She raised her face.</p>

<p>"I am not crying; I never cry when I think of papa, uncle,
Why should I? I loved him too well to wish him back from
Heaven."</p>

<p>The old man looked down at her with a touch of awe in his
eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," he murmured; "it was his wish that you should
remain there at school. He knew what I was, an aimless dreamer,
a man living out of the world, and no fit guardian for a
young girl. Oh, yes, Harold knew. He acted for the best, and
I was content. My life was too lonely, and quiet, and lifeless
for a young girl, and I thought that all was right, while those
fiends&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She put her hand on his arm.</p>

<p>"Do not let us speak of them, or think of them any more, uncle.
You will let me stay with you, will you not? I shall not think
your life lonely; it will be a Paradise after that which I have
left&mdash;Paradise. And, see, I will strive to make it less lonely;
but"&mdash;and she turned suddenly with a look of troubled fear&mdash;"but
perhaps I shall be in your way?" and she looked round.</p>

<p>"No, no," he said, and he put his hand to his brow. "It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
strange! I never felt my loneliness till now! and I would not
have you go for all the world!"</p>

<p>She wound her arms round him, and nestled closer, and there
was silence for a space; then he said:</p>

<p>"How old are you, Stella?"</p>

<p>She thought a moment.</p>

<p>"Nineteen, uncle."</p>

<p>"Nineteen&mdash;a child!" he murmured; then he looked at her,
and his lips moved inaudibly as he thought, "Beautiful as an
angel," but she heard him, and her face flushed, but the next
moment she looked up frankly and simply.</p>

<p>"You would not say that much if you had seen my mamma.
<i>She</i> was beautiful as an angel. Papa used to say that he wished
you could have seen her; that you would have liked to paint her.
Yes, she was beautiful."</p>

<p>The artist nodded.</p>

<p>"Poor, motherless child!" he murmured.</p>

<p>"Yes, she was beautiful," continued the girl, softly. "I can
just remember her, uncle. Papa never recovered from her
death. He always said that he counted the days till he should
meet her again. He loved her so, you see."</p>

<p>There was silence again; then the artist spoke:</p>

<p>"You speak English with scarcely an accent, Stella."</p>

<p>The girl laughed; it was the first time she had laughed, and it
caused the uncle to start. It was not only because it was unexpected,
but because of its exquisite music. It was like the trill
of a bird. In an instant he felt that her childish sorrow had not
imbittered her life or broken her spirit. He found himself
almost unconsciously laughing in harmony.</p>

<p>"What a strange observation, uncle!" she said, when the laugh
had died away. "Why I am English! right to the backbone, as
papa used to say. Often and often he used to look at me and
say: 'Italy has no part and parcel in you beyond your birth,
Stella; you belong to that little island which floats on the Atlantic
and rules the world.' Oh, yes, I am English. I should be sorry
to be anything else, notwithstanding mamma was an Italian."</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember Harold&mdash;your father&mdash;always said you
were an English girl. I am glad of that."</p>

<p>"So am I," said the girl, naively.</p>

<p>Then he relapsed into one of his dreamy silences, and she
waited silent and motionless. Suddenly he felt her quiver under
his arm, and heave a long, deep sigh.</p>

<p>With a start he looked down; her face had gone wofully pale
to the very lips.</p>

<p>"Stella!" he cried, "what is it? Are you ill? Great Heaven!"</p>

<p>She smiled up at him.</p>

<p>"No, no, only a little tired; and," with naive simplicity, "I
think I am a little hungry. You see, I only had enough for the
fare."</p>

<p>"Heaven forgive me!" he cried, starting up so suddenly as almost
to upset her. "Here have I been dreaming and mooning
while the child was starving. What a brainless idiot I am!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>And in his excitement he hurried up and down the room,
knocking over a painting here and a lay figure there, and looking
aimlessly about as if he expected to see something in the
shape of food floating in the air.</p>

<p>At last with his hand to his brow he bethought him of the
bell, and rang it until the little cottage resounded as if it were
a fire-engine station. There was a hurried patter of footsteps
outside, the door was suddenly opened, and a middle-aged woman
ran in, with a cap very much awry and a face startled
and flushed.</p>

<p>"Gracious me, sir, what's the matter?" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Mr. Etheridge dropped the bell, and without a word of explanation,
exclaimed&mdash;"Bring something to eat at once, Mrs. Penfold,
and some wine, at once, please. The poor child is starving."</p>

<p>The woman looked at him with amazement, that increased as
glancing round the room she failed to see any poor child, Stella
being hidden behind the antique high-backed chair.</p>

<p>"Poor child, what poor child! You've been dreaming, Mr.
Etheridge!"</p>

<p>"No, no!" he said, meekly; "it's all true, Mrs. Penfold. She
has come all the way from Florence without a morsel to eat."</p>

<p>Stella rose from her ambush.</p>

<p>"Not all the way from Florence, uncle," she said.</p>

<p>Mrs. Penfold started and stared at the visitor.</p>

<p>"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed; "who is it?"</p>

<p>Mr. Etheridge rubbed his brow.</p>

<p>"Did I not tell you? It is my niece&mdash;my niece Stella. She
has come from Italy, and&mdash;I wish you'd bring some food. Bring
a bottle of the old wine. Sit down and rest, Stella. This is Mrs.
Penfold&mdash;she is my housekeeper, and a good woman, but,"&mdash;he
added, without lowering his tone in the slightest, though he was
evidently under the idea that he was inaudible&mdash;"but rather
slow in comprehension."</p>

<p>Mrs. Penfold came forward, still flushed and excited, and with
a smile.</p>

<p>"Your niece, sir! Not Mr. Harold's daughter that you so often
have spoken of! Why, how did you come in, miss?"</p>

<p>"I found the door open," said Stella.</p>

<p>"Good gracious me! And dropped from the clouds! And
that must have been an hour ago! And you, sir," looking at the
bewildered artist reproachfully, "you let the dear young thing
sit here with her hat and jacket on all that time, after coming
all that way, without sending for me."</p>

<p>"We didn't want you," said the old man, calmly.</p>

<p>"Want me! No! But the dear child wanted something to eat,
and to rest, and to take her things off. Oh, come with me, miss!
All the way from Florence, and Mr. Harold's daughter!"</p>

<p>"Go with her, Stella," said the old man, "and&mdash;and," he
added, gently, "don't let her keep you long."</p>

<p>The infinite tenderness of the last words caused Stella to stop
on her way to the door; she came back, and, putting her arms
around his neck, kissed him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>Then she followed Mrs. Penfold up-stairs to her room, the
good woman talking the whole while in exclamatory sentences
of astonishment.</p>

<p>"And you are Mr. Harold's daughter. Did you see his portrait
over the mantel-shelf, miss? I should have known you by
that, now I come to look at you," and she looked with affectionate
interest into the beautiful face, as she helped Stella to take
off her hat. "Yes, I should have known you, miss, in a
moment? And you have come all the way from Italy? Dear
me, it is wonderful. And I'm very glad you have, it won't be
so lonely for Mr. Etheridge. And is there anything else you
want, miss? You must excuse me for bringing you into my
own room; I'll have a room ready for you to-night, your own
room, and the luggage, miss&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Stella smiled and blushed faintly.</p>

<p>"I have none, Mrs. Penfold. I ran&mdash;I left quite suddenly."</p>

<p>"Dearie me!" murmured Mrs. Penfold, puzzled and sympathetic.
"Well, now, it doesn't matter so long as you are here,
safe, and sound. And now I'll go and get you something to eat!
You can find your way down?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Stella said. She could find her way down. She
stood for a moment looking through the window, her long hair
falling in a silky stream down her white shoulders, and the soft,
dreamy look came into her eyes.</p>

<p>"Is it true?" she murmured. "Am I really here at home
with someone to love me&mdash;someone whom I can love? Or is it
only a dream, and shall I wake in the cold bare room and find
that I have still to endure the old life? No! It is no dream, it
is true!"</p>

<p>She wound up the long hair and went down to find that Mrs.
Penfold had already prepared the table, her uncle standing beside
and waiting with gentle impatience for her appearance.</p>

<p>He started as she entered, with a distinct feeling of renewed
surprise; the relief from uncertainty as to her welcome, the
kindness of her reception had already refreshed her, and her
beauty shone out unclouded by doubt or nervousness.</p>

<p>The old man's eyes wandered with artistic approval over the
graceful form and lovely face, and he was almost in the land of
dreams again when Mrs. Penfold roused him by setting a chair
at the table, and handing him a cobwebbed bottle and a corkscrew.</p>

<p>"Miss Stella must be starving, sir!" she said, suggestively.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," he assented, and both of them set to work exhorting
and encouraging her to eat, as if they feared she might drop
under the table with exhaustion unless she could be persuaded
to eat of everything on the table.</p>

<p>Mr. Etheridge seemed to place great faith in the old port as a
restorative, and had some difficulty in concealing his disappointment
when Stella, after sipping the first glass, declined any
more on the score that it was strong.</p>

<p>At last, but with visible reluctance, he accepted her assertion
that she was rescued from any chance of starvation, and Mrs.
Penfold cleared the table and left them alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>A lamp stood on the table, but the moonbeams poured in
through the window, and instinctively Stella drew near the
window.</p>

<p>"What a lovely place it is, uncle!" she said.</p>

<p>He did not answer, he was watching her musingly, as she
leant against the edge of the wall.</p>

<p>"You must be very happy here."</p>

<p>"Yes," he murmured, dreamily. "Yes, and you think you
will be, Stella."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," she answered, in a low voice, and with a low sigh.
"Happier than I can say."</p>

<p>"You will not feel it lonely, shut up with an old man, a
dreamer, who has parted with the world and almost forgotten
it?"</p>

<p>"No, no! a thousand times no!" was the reply.</p>

<p>He wandered to the fireplace and took up his pipe, but with a
sudden glance at her laid it down again. Slight as was the
action she saw it, and with the graceful, lithe movement which
he had noticed, she glided across the room and took up the
pipe.</p>

<p>"You were going to smoke, uncle."</p>

<p>"No, no," he said, eagerly. "No, a mere habit&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She interrupted him with a smile, and filled the pipe for him
with her taper little fingers, and gave it to him.</p>

<p>"You do not want me to wish that I had not come to you
uncle?"</p>

<p>"Heaven forbid!" he said, simply.</p>

<p>"Then you must not alter anything in your life; you must go
on as if I had never dropped from the clouds to be a burden
upon you."</p>

<p>"My child!" he murmured, reproachfully.</p>

<p>"Or to make you uncomfortable. I could not bear that,
uncle."</p>

<p>"No, no!" he said, "I will alter nothing, Stella; we will be
happy, you and I."</p>

<p>"Very happy," she murmured, softly.</p>

<p>He wandered to the window, and stood looking out; and, unseen
by him, she drew a chair up and cleared it of the litter, and
unconsciously he sat down.</p>

<p>Then she glided to and fro, wandering round the room noiselessly,
looking at the curious lumber, and instinctively picking
up the books and putting them in something like order on the
almost empty shelves.</p>

<p>Every now and then she took up one of the pictures which
stood with their faces to the wall, and her gaze would wander
from it to the painter sitting in the moonlight, his white hair
falling on his shoulders, his thin, nervous hands clasped on his
knee.</p>

<p>She, who had spent her life in the most artistic city of the
world, knew that he was a great painter, and, child-woman as
she was, wondered why the world permitted him to remain unknown
and unnoticed. She had yet to learn that he cared as
little for fame as he did for wealth, and to be allowed to live for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
his art and dream in peace was all he asked from the world in
which he lived but in which he took no part. Presently she
came back to the window, and stood beside him; he started
slightly and put out his hand, and she put her thin white one
into it. The moon rose higher in the heavens, and the old man
raised his other hand and pointed to it in silence.</p>

<p>As he did so, Stella saw glide into the scene&mdash;as it was touched
by the moonbeams&mdash;a large white building rearing above the
trees on the hill-top, and she uttered an exclamation of surprise.</p>

<p>"What house is that, uncle? I had no idea one was there
until this moment!"</p>

<p>"That is Wyndward Hall, Stella," he replied, dreamily; "it
was hidden by the shadow and the clouds."</p>

<p>"What a grand place!" she murmured. "Who lives there
uncle?"</p>

<p>"The Wyndwards," he answered, in the same musing tone,
"the Wyndwards. They have lived there for hundreds of years,
Stella. Yes, it is a grand place."</p>

<p>"We should call it a palace in Italy, uncle."</p>

<p>"It is a palace in England, but we are more modest. They
are contented to call it the Hall. An old place and an old race."</p>

<p>"Tell me about them," she said, quietly. "Do you know
them&mdash;are they friends of yours?"</p>

<p>"I know them. Yes, they are friends, as far as there be any
friendship between a poor painter and the Lord of Wyndward.
Yes, we are friends; they call them proud, but they are not too
proud to ask James Etheridge to dinner occasionally; and they
accuse him of pride because he declines to break the stillness of
his life by accepting their hospitality. Look to the left there,
Stella. As far as you can see stretch the lands of Wyndward&mdash;they
run for miles between the hills there."</p>

<p>"They have some reason to be proud," she murmured, with a
smile. "But I like them because they are kind to you."</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes, the earl would be more than kind, I think&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The earl?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Lord Wyndward, the head of the family; the Lord of
Wyndward they call him. They have all been called Lords of
Wyndward by the people here, who look up to them as if they
were something more than human."</p>

<p>"And does he live there alone?" she asked, gazing at the gray
stone mansion glistening in the moonlight.</p>

<p>"No, there is a Lady Wyndward, and a daughter&mdash;poor girl."</p>

<p>"Why do you say poor girl?" asked Stella.</p>

<p>"Because all the wealth of the race would not make her otherwise
than an object of tender pity. She is an invalid; you see
that window&mdash;the one with the light in it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Stella said.</p>

<p>"That is the window of her room; she lies there on a sofa,
looking down the valley all the day!"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>




<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">"Poor</span> girl!" murmured Stella. There was silence for a moment.
"And those three live there all alone?" she said.</p>

<p>"Not always," he replied, musingly. "Sometimes, not often,
the son Leycester comes down. He is Viscount Trevor."</p>

<p>"The son," said Stella.  "And what is he like?"</p>

<p>The question seemed to set some train of thought in action;
the old man relapsed into silence for a few minutes. Then suddenly
but gently he rose, and going to the other end of the room,
fetched a picture from amongst several standing against the
wall, and held it toward her.</p>

<p>"That is Lord Leycester," he said.</p>

<p>Stella took the canvas in her hand, and held it to the light,
and an exclamation broke involuntarily from her lips.</p>

<p>"How beautiful he is!"</p>

<p>The old man took the picture from her, and resting it on his
knees, gazed at it musingly.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "it is a grand face; one does not see such a
face often."</p>

<p>Stella leant over the chair and looked at it with a strange
feeling of interest and curiosity, such as no simply beautiful picture
would have aroused.</p>

<p>It was not the regularity of the face, with its clear-cut features
and its rippling chestnut hair, that, had it been worn by a
Wyndward of a hundred years ago, would have fallen in rich
curls upon the square, well-formed shoulders. It was not the
beauty of the face, but a something indefinable in the carriage
of the head and the expression of the full, dark eyes that attracted,
almost fascinated, her.</p>

<p>It was in a voice almost hushed by the indescribable effect
produced by the face, that she said:</p>

<p>"And he is like that?"</p>

<p>"It is lifelike," he answered. "I, who painted it, should not
say it, but it is like him nevertheless&mdash;that is Leycester Wyndward.
Why did you ask?"</p>

<p>Stella hesitated.</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;I scarcely know. It is such a strange face, uncle.
The eyes&mdash;what is it in the eyes that makes me almost unable to
look away from them?"</p>

<p>"The reflection of a man's soul, Stella," he said.</p>

<p>It was a strange answer, and the girl looked down at the
strange face interrogatively.</p>

<p>"The reflection of a man's soul, Stella. The Wyndwards
have always been a wild, reckless, passionate race; here, in this
village, they have innumerable legends of the daring deeds of
the lords of Wyndward. Murder, rapine, and high-handed
tyranny in the olden times, wild license and desperate profligacy
in these modern ones; but of all the race this Leycester Wyndward
is the wildest and most heedless. Look at him, Stella, you
see him here in his loose shooting-jacket, built by Poole; with
the diamond pin in his irreproachable scarf, with his hair cut
to the regulation length: I see him in armor with his sword upraised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
to watch the passionate fire of his eyes. There is a
picture in the great gallery up yonder of one of the Wyndwards
clad just so, in armor of glittering steel, with one foot on the
body of a prostrate foe, one hand upraised to strike the death-dealing
blow of his battle-ax. Yes, Leycester Wyndward
should have lived four centuries back."</p>

<p>Stella smiled.</p>

<p>"Has he committed many murders, uncle, burnt down many
villages?"</p>

<p>The old man started and looked up at the exquisite face, with
its arch smile beaming in the dark eyes and curving the red, ripe
lips, and smiled in response.</p>

<p>"I was dreaming, Stella; an odd trick of mine. No, men of
his stamp are sadly circumscribed nowadays. We have left
them no vent for their natures now, excepting the gambling-table,
the turf, and&mdash;&mdash;" he roused suddenly. "Yes, it's a beautiful
face, Stella, but it belongs to a man who has done more
harm in his day than all his forefathers did before him. It is
rather a good thing that Wyndward Hall stands so firmly, or
else Leycester would have melted it at ecarte and baccarat long
ago."</p>

<p>"Is he so bad then?" murmured Stella.</p>

<p>Her uncle smiled.</p>

<p>"Bad is a mild word, Stella; and yet&mdash;look at the face again.
I have seen it softened by a smile such as might have been worn
by an innocent child; I have heard those lips laugh as&mdash;as women
are supposed to laugh before this world has driven all laughter
out of them; and when those eyes smile there is no resisting
them for man or woman."</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly and looked up.</p>

<p>"I am wandering on like an old mill. Put the picture away,
Stella."</p>

<p>She took it from him and carried it across the room, but stood
for a moment silently regarding it by the lamp light. As she
did so, a strange fancy made her start and set the picture on the
table suddenly. It seemed to her as if the dark eyes had suddenly
softened in their intense fixed gaze and smiled at her.</p>

<p>It was the trick of a warm, imaginative temperament, and it
took possession of her so completely that with a swift gesture
she laid her hand over the dark eyes and so hid them.</p>

<p>Then, with a laugh at her own folly, she put the picture
against the wall and went back to the window and sat beside
the old man.</p>

<p>"Tell me about your past life, Stella," he said, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"It seems to me as if you had always been here. You have a
quiet way of speaking and moving about, child."</p>

<p>"I learnt that while papa was ill," she said, simply. "Sometimes
he would sit for hours playing softly, and I did not wish
to disturb him."</p>

<p>"I remember, I remember," he murmured. "Stella, the world
should have known something of him; he was a born musician."</p>

<p>"He used to say the same of you, uncle; you should have been
a famous artist."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>The old man looked up with a smile.</p>

<p>"My child, there are many men whom the world knows nothing
of&mdash;luckily for them. Your father and I were dreamers,
both; the world likes men of action. Can you play?"</p>

<p>She rose and stood for a moment hesitating. In the corner of
the room there was a small chamber organ&mdash;one of those wonderful
instruments which in a small space combine the grand
tones of a cathedral organ with the melodious softness of a flute.
It was one of the few luxuries which the artist had permitted
himself, and he was in the habit of playing snatches of Verdi and
Rossini, of Schubert and Mozart, when the fading light compelled
him to lay the brush aside.</p>

<p>Stella went up to it softly and seated herself, and presently began
to play. She attempted no difficult fugue or brilliant march,
but played a simple Florentine vesper hymn, which she had
heard floating from the devout lips of the women kneeling before
the altar of the great church in Florence, and presently began
to sing it.</p>

<p>The old man started as the first clear bird-like notes rose softly
upon the evening air, and then covering his face with his
hands went straight to dreamland.</p>

<p>The vesper hymn died softly, slowly out, and she rose, but
with a gesture of his hand he motioned her to remain at the
organ.</p>

<p>"You have your father's voice, Stella; sing again."</p>

<p>She sang a pleasant ditty this time, with a touch of pathos in
the refrain, and hearing a slight noise as she finished, looked
round, and saw the old man rise, and with quivering lips turn
toward the door.</p>

<p>The young girl's sweet voice had brought back the past and
its dead too plainly, and he had gone out lest she should see his
emotion.</p>

<p>Stella rose and went to the window, and stood looking into
the night. The moonlight was glinting the river in the distance,
and falling in great masses upon the lawn at her feet. Half unconsciously
she opened the window, and stepping out, found
herself in a small garden, beautifully kept and fragrant with
violets; her love for flowers was a passion, and she stepped on
to the path in search of them. The path led in zigzag fashion to
a little wooden gate, by which the garden was entered from the
lane. Stella found some violets, and looking about in search of
further treasure store, saw a bunch of lilac blossom growing in
the lane side.</p>

<p>To open the gate and run lightly up the side of the bank was
the impulse of the moment, and she obeyed it; there were still
deeper masses of flowers a little further down, and she was
walking toward them when she heard the sound of a horse galloping
toward her.</p>

<p>For a moment she was so startled by the unexpected sound
that she stood looking toward the direction whence it came,
and in that moment a horse and rider turned the corner and
made full pelt for the spot where she was standing. Stella
glanced back toward the little white gate to discover that it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
not in sight, and that she had gone further than she intended.
It was of no use to attempt to get back before the horseman
reached her, there was only time to get out of the way. Lightly
springing up the bank, she stood under the lilac tree and
waited.</p>

<p>As she did so, the horse and man came out of the shadow into
the moonlight. To Stella, both looked tremendously big and tall
in the deceptive light, but it was not the size, but the attitude
of the rider which struck her and chained her attention.</p>

<p>She could not see his face, but the figure was that of a young
man, tall and stalwart, and full of a strange, masterful grace
which displayed itself in the easy, reckless way in which he sat
the great animal, and in the poise of the head which, slightly
thrown back, seemed in its very attitude eloquent of pride and
defiance. There was something strange and unusual about the
whole bearing that struck Stella, unused as she was to meeting
horsemen in an English country lane.</p>

<p>As he came a little nearer she noticed that he was dressed in
evening dress, excepting his coat, which was of velvet, and sat
loosely, yet gracefully, upon the stalwart frame. In simple truth
the rider had thrown off his dress coat for a smoking jacket,
and still wore his dress boots. Stella saw the moonlight shining
upon them and upon a ruby, which blazed sullenly upon the
white hand which held the whip.</p>

<p>As if rider and horse were one, they came up the lane, and
were abreast of her, the man all unconscious of her presence.
But not so the horse; his quick, restless eye had caught sight of
the shimmer of Stella's dress, and with a toss of the head he
swerved aside and stood still. The rider brought his eyes from
the sky, and raising his whip, cut the horse across the flank,
with a gesture of impatient anger; but the horse&mdash;a splendid,
huge-boned Irish mare, as fiery and obstinate as a lion&mdash;rose on
its hind legs instantly, and the whip came down again.</p>

<p>"Confound you! what is the matter?" exclaimed its master.
"Go on, you idiot!"</p>

<p>The horse pricked its ears at the sound of the familiar voice,
but stood stock still, quivering in every limb.</p>

<p>Stella saw the whip raised again, and instinctively, before she
was aware of it, her womanly protest sprang from her lips.</p>

<p>"No! no!"</p>

<p>At the sound of the eager, imploring voice, the rider kept his
whip poised in the air, then let his arm fall, and dragging rather
than guiding the horse, forced it near the hedge.</p>

<p>"Who is it? Who are you?" he demanded, angrily. "What
the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then he stopped suddenly, and stared speechlessly, motionless,
and transfixed&mdash;horse and rider, as it were, turned to stone.</p>

<p>Tall and graceful, with that grace which belongs to the girlhood
which stands on the threshold of womanhood, with her exquisite
face fixed in an expression of mingled fear and pity, and
a shyness struggling with maidenly pride, she made a picture
which was lovely enough to satisfy the requirements of the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
critical and artistic mind&mdash;a picture which he who looked upon
it carried with him till the day he died.</p>

<p>For a moment he sat motionless, and as he sat the moon
fell full upon his face, and Stella saw the face of the portrait
whose eyes she had but a few minutes since hidden from her
sight.</p>

<p>A lifetime of emotion may pass in a minute; a life's fate hangs
upon the balance of a stroke of time. It was only for a moment
that they looked into each other's eyes in silence, but that
moment meant so much to each of them! It was the horse
that broke the spell by attempting to rise again. With a slight
movement of the hand Leycester Wyndward forced him down,
and then slid from the saddle and stood at Stella's feet, hat in
hand.</p>

<p>Even then he paused as if afraid, lest a word should cause
the vision to vanish into thin air; but at last he opened his lips.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon."</p>

<p>That was all. Four words only, and words that one hears
daily; words that have almost lost their import from too familiar
commonplace, and yet, as he said them, they sounded so
entirely, so earnestly, so intensely significant and full of meaning
that all the commonplace drifted from them, and they conveyed
to the listener's ear a real and eager prayer for forgiveness;
so real and earnest that to have passed them by with the
conventional smile and bow would have been an insult, and impossible.</p>

<p>But it was not only the words and the tone, but the voice
that thrilled through Stella's soul, and seemed to wake an echoing
chord. The picture which had so awed her had been dumb
and voiceless; but now it seemed as if it had spoken even as it
had smiled, and for a moment she felt a woman's desire to shut
out the sound, as she had shut out the smiling eyes.</p>

<p>It was the maidenly impulse of self-protection, against what
evil she did not know or dream.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," he said again, his voice deep and musical,
his eyes raised to hers. "I am afraid I frightened you. I
thought I was alone here. Will you forgive me?"</p>

<p>Stella looked down at him, and a faint color stole into her
cheeks.</p>

<p>"It is I who should beg pardon; I am not frightened, but
your horse was&mdash;and by me?"</p>

<p>He half glanced at the horse standing quiet enough now, with
its bridle over his arm.</p>

<p>"He is an idiot!" he said, quickly; "an obstinate idiot, and
incapable of fear. It was mere pretense."</p>

<p>"For which you punished him," said Stella, with a quick
smile.</p>

<p>He looked up at her, and slowly there came into his eyes and
his lips that smile of which Mr. Etheridge had spoken, and which
Stella had foreseen.</p>

<p>"You are afraid I am going to whip him again?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, with simple directness.</p>

<p>He looked at her with a curious smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are right," he said; "I was. There are times when he
requires a little correction; to-night is one of them. We have
not seen each other for some little time, and he has forgotten
who is master. But I shall not forget your 'No,' and will spare
the whip; are you satisfied?"</p>

<p>It was a strange speech, closing with a strangely abrupt question.
It was characteristic of the speaker, who never in all his
life probably had known for a moment what nervousness or embarrassment
meant. Judging by his tone, the easy flow of the
musical voice, the frank, open manner, one would have imagined
that this meeting with a strange and beautiful girl was the most
matter-of-fact affair.</p>

<p>"Are you satisfied?" he repeated, as Stella remained silent,
trying to fight against the charm of his simple and direct manner.
"If not, perhaps that will do it?" and taking the whip, a
strong hunter's crop, in both his white hands, he broke it in two
as easily as if it were a reed, and flung it over his shoulder.</p>

<p>Stella flushed, but she laughed, and her dark eyes beamed
down upon him with serious archness.</p>

<p>"Does not that look as if you were afraid you should not keep
your promise?"</p>

<p>He smiled up at her.</p>

<p>"It does," he said&mdash;"you are right; I may have been tempted
beyond my strength. He is a bad-tempered beast, and I am
another. Why do you laugh&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>He broke off, his voice changing as subtly as some musical instrument.</p>

<p>Stella hesitated a moment.</p>

<p>"I beg you will tell me&mdash;I shall not be offended."</p>

<p>She laughed, and clung with one hand to the lilac, looking
down on him.</p>

<p>"I was thinking how fortunate it was that he could not whip
you. It is not fair, as you are both so bad-tempered, that one
only should get punished."</p>

<p>He did not laugh, as another man would have done; but there
came into the dark eyes a flash of surprised amusement, such as
might have shone in those of the giant Gulliver when some
Liliputian struck him with a pin-sized stick; and his lips parted
with a smile.</p>

<p>"It was a natural reflection," he said, after a pause. "Will
you let me help you down?"</p>

<p>Stella shook her head. Somehow she felt safe up there above
him, where but the dark eyes could reach her.</p>

<p>"Thank you, no; I am gathering some lilac. Do not trouble."</p>

<p>And she turned slightly from him, and stretched up her hand
for a branch above her head. The next moment he sprang up
the bank lightly, and stood beside her.</p>

<p>"Permit me," he said. And with one sweep he drew the fragrant
branch within her reach.</p>

<p>"And now will you come down?" he asked, as if she were
some willful child. Stella smiled, and he held out his hand.
She put hers into it, and his fingers closed over it with a grasp
firm as steel, but as smooth as a woman's. As the warm fingers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
closed over hers, which were cold with her long grasp of the
branch above her head, a thrill ran through her and caused her
to shudder slightly.</p>

<p>"You are cold," he said, instantly. "The Spring evenings
are treacherous. Have you far to go?"</p>

<p>"I am not cold, thanks," she said, with quick alarm, for there
was a look in his eyes and a movement of his hand which seemed
to give warning that he was about to take his coat off.</p>

<p>"I am not at all cold!"</p>

<p>"Have you far to go?" he repeated, with the air, gentle as it
was, of a man who was accustomed to have his questions answered.</p>

<p>"Not far; to the little white gate there," she answered.</p>

<p>"The little white gate&mdash;to Etheridge's, the artist's?" he said
gently, with a tone of surprise.</p>

<p>Stella bent her head; his eyes scanned her face.</p>

<p>"You live there&mdash;are staying there?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I never saw you in Wyndward before."</p>

<p>"No, I was never here till to-night."</p>

<p>"Till to-night?" he echoed. "I knew that I had not seen you
before."</p>

<p>There was something in the tone, wholly unlike commonplace
flattery, that brought the color to Stella's face.</p>

<p>They had reached the gate by this time, he walking by her
side, the bridle thrown over his arm, the great horse pacing quiet
and lamb-like, and Stella stopped.</p>

<p>"Good-night," she said.</p>

<p>He stopped short and looked at her, his head thrown back, as
she had seen it as he rode toward her, his eyes fixed intently on
her face, and seeming to sink through her downcast eyes into
her soul.</p>

<p>"Good-night," he replied. "Wait."</p>

<p>It was a word of command, for all its musical gentleness, and
Stella, woman-like, stopped.</p>

<p>"I am going away," he said, not abruptly, but with calm
directness. "If you have only come to-night I shall not be able
to learn your name; before I go, will you tell it me?"</p>

<p>Stella smiled.</p>

<p>"Why not?" he said, as she hesitated.</p>

<p>"My name is Stella Etheridge, I am Mr. Etheridge's niece."</p>

<p>"Stella!" he repeated. "Stella! Thank you. I shall not
forget. My name," and he raised his hat with a simple gesture
of proud humility, "is Wyndward&mdash;Leycester Wyndward."</p>

<p>"I know it," said Stella, and the next moment she could have
called the impulsive words back again.</p>

<p>"You know it!" he said; "and came here only to-night!
How is that?"</p>

<p>Stella's brows contracted, dark and full they met across her
brow in true southern fashion, and lent a significant eloquence
to her face; she would have given much to avoid answering.</p>

<p>"How is that?" he asked, his eyes fixed on hers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is very simple," she said, as if vexed at her hesitation. "I
saw your portrait and&mdash;knew you."</p>

<p>He smiled a curious smile.</p>

<p>"Knew me before we met! I wonder&mdash;&mdash;" he paused and his
eyes seemed to read her thoughts. "I wonder whether you
were prejudiced by what you saw by that forshadowing of me?
Is that a fair question?"</p>

<p>"It is a strange one," said Stella.</p>

<p>"Is it? I will not press it. Good-night!" and he raised his
hat.</p>

<p>"Good-night, and good-bye," she said, and impulsively again
she held out her hand.</p>

<p>His eyes showed no surprise, whatever he may have felt, as
he took her hand and held it.</p>

<p>"No," he said, as he let her draw it away. "Not good-bye. I
have changed my mind. I shall not go. It is only good-night,"
and with a smile flashing out of his eyes, he leapt upon his horse
and was gone.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Stella</span> stood watching until the big chestnut had borne its
master out of sight, and down the lane, across the meadow; she
caught one more glimpse of them as he rode through the ford,
the water dashing up a silver shower of spray as high as the
horse's head; then they vanished in the shadow of the woods
which engirdled Wyndward Hall.</p>

<p>But she still stood, lost in a dreamy reverie that was not
thought, until her uncle's voice came floating down the garden,
and with a start she ran up the path and stood breathless before
him.</p>

<p>The old man's placid face wore a slight look of anxiety, which
faded instantly as he said:</p>

<p>"Where have you been, Stella? I thought you had changed
your mind, and flown back to Italy again. Mrs. Penfold is
searching the meadows wildly."</p>

<p>Stella laughed, as she put her arm round his neck.</p>

<p>"You will not get rid of me so easily, uncle. No, I have only
been down the pretty lane at the end of the garden. See, here
are some flowers; are they not sweet? You shall have them for
your table, and they shall stand within sight while you are at
work." And she filled a vase with water, and arranged them.
"But the flowers are not all the fruits of my wandering, uncle,"
she went on; "I have had an adventure."</p>

<p>He was strolling up and down with his pipe in his mouth, his
hands folded behind him.</p>

<p>"An adventure!"</p>

<p>"Yes," she nodded. "I have met&mdash;can you guess whom?"</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>"Mr. Fielding, the clergyman? It is his usual evening stroll."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Perhaps an old lady in a lace shawl, with a fat pug by her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
side. If so, you have made an acquaintance with the great Mrs.
Hamilton, the doctor's wife."</p>

<p>"No, it was not anybody's wife, uncle&mdash;it was a man. You
shan't guess any more; but what do you say to Lord Leycester?"</p>

<p>"Lord Leycester!" said Mr. Etheridge. "I did not even know
he was at home. Lord Leycester! And does my picture do him
justice?" he asked, turning to her with a smile.</p>

<p>She bent over the flowers, ashamed of the meaningless blush
which rose to her face.</p>

<p>"Yes, uncle, it is like him; but I could not see very distinctly
you know. It was moonlight. He was riding a great, huge
chestnut horse."</p>

<p>"I know," he murmured, "and tearing along like a lost
spirit. He flashed past like a meteor, I expect. No, you could
not see him, and cannot judge of my portrait."</p>

<p>"But he didn't flash past. He would have done, no doubt,
but the chestnut declined. I think it was frightened by me, for
I was standing on the bank."</p>

<p>"And he stopped?" asked Mr. Etheridge. "It was a wonder;
such a little thing even as the shying of his horse was sufficient
to rouse the devil in him! He stopped!"</p>

<p>"Because he was obliged," said Stella, in a low voice, a deep
blush of maidenly shame rising to her face, as she remembers
that it was she who had really stopped him.</p>

<p>"And was he very furious?"</p>

<p>"No; the proverbial lamb could not have been more quiet,"
said Stella, with a musical laugh.</p>

<p>Mr. Etheridge laughed.</p>

<p>"He must have been in a good humor. It was strange his
being out to-night. The Hall is full of people from town; but
it would not matter to him if he wanted to ride, though the
prince himself were there; he would go. And my picture?"</p>

<p>"Did him justice, uncle. Yes, he is very handsome; he wore
a loose velvet coat to-night of a dark purple; I did not know
gentlemen wore such colors now."</p>

<p>"A smoking coat," he explained. "I think I can see him.
No doubt he had obeyed the impulse of the moment&mdash;had jumped
up and left them there at the Hall&mdash;saddled his own horse and
tore away across the river. Well, you have probably seen the
last of him for some time, Stella. He rarely stays at the Hall
more than a day or two. Town has too great a charm for him."</p>

<p>Stella's lips opened, and she was about to reply that he had
suddenly resolved to stay, but something stopped the words on
her lips.</p>

<p>Presently there was a knock at the door, and Mrs. Penfold came
in with the candles.</p>

<p>"You have given me quite a turn, Miss Stella," she said, with
a smile of reproach; "I thought you were lost. Your room is
quite ready now, miss."</p>

<p>Stella went up to the old man and kissed him.</p>

<p>"Good-night, uncle," she murmured.</p>

<p>"Good-night, my child," he said, his eyes dwelling on her tenderly,
but with something of the bewildered look clouding them;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
"Good-night, and happy dreams for this, your first night at
home."</p>

<p>"At home!" murmured Stella; "at home! You are very good
to me, uncle," and she kissed him again.</p>

<p>Mrs. Penfold had done wonders in so short a time permitted
her, and Stella found herself standing alone in a tiny room,
modestly but comfortably&mdash;oh, so comfortably!&mdash;furnished, with
its white bed and its old-fashioned dimity curtains framing the
lattice window. As her gaze wandered round the room, her
glorious eyes grew moist. It was all so sudden, so sweet a contrast
to the gaunt, bare room, which, for a weary year she had
shared with a score of girls as miserable as herself; so sudden
that she could scarcely believe it was real.</p>

<p>But youth is ever ready to accept the surprises of life, and she
fell asleep&mdash;fell asleep to dream that she was back in the wretched
school in Italy, and chained to a stone wall from which all her
efforts to free herself were unavailing, but presently she thought
that a tall, stalwart figure came riding down on a big chestnut
horse, and that with one sweep of his strong hand he broke her
chains asunder, and, lifting her into his saddle, bore her away.
Then the scene changed; she seemed to be following her rescuer
who, with his handsome face turned over his shoulder, drew her
on continually with a strange fascinating smile. All through
her dreams the smiling eyes haunted her, and once she stretched
out her hands to keep it from her, but even in the action the
gesture of repulse turned in a strange, subtle manner to one of
entreaty and welcome, and she drew the smile, as it were, to her
bosom, and folded her hands over it. A girlish fancy, perhaps,
but such fancies influence a life for good or ill, for joy or misery.</p>

<p>Lord Leycester Wyndward, of whose smile Stella was dreaming,
had ridden up the hills, the great chestnut scarcely breaking
his pace, but breathing hard and defiantly from its wide, red
nostrils&mdash;had ridden up the hills and through the woods, and
reached the open plateau lying round the Hall.</p>

<p>A noble park occupied the plateau&mdash;a park of chestnuts and
oaks, which were the pride of the county. Through the park
wound the road, gleaming white in the moonlight, to the front
gates of Wyndward. The lodge-keeper heard the beat of the
chestnut's feet, for which he had been listening intently, and
threw open the gates, and Lord Leycester entered the grounds.
They were vast in extent and exquisitely laid out, the road winding
between a noble avenue of trees that arched overhead. The
present earl's grandfather had gone in for arboriculture, and the
way was lined for fifty feet back with rare shrubs and conifers.</p>

<p>So serpentine was the road that the great gray mansion
broke upon the gaze suddenly, mentally startling him who
approached it for the first time.</p>

<p>To Lord Leycester it was a familiar sight, but familiar as it
was he glanced up at it with what was almost a nod of approval.
Like most men of his nature, he possessed a passionate love and
appreciation for the beautiful, and there was to-night a strange,
indefinable fire in his hot blood which made him more than
usually susceptible to the influence of the scene. A sweeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
curve of the road led to the terrace which stretched along
the whole front of the house, and by which the principal entrance
was gained.</p>

<p>Lord Leycester struck off to the right, and entered a modern
courtyard, three sides of which were occupied by the admirable
stables. A couple of grooms had been listening as
intently as the lodge-keeper, and as he entered the yard they
hurried forward silently and took the chestnut. Lord Leycester
dropped to the ground, patted the horse, which made a
playfully-affectionate snap at his arm, and, ascending a flight
of steps, entered the lower end of the long hall, which stretched
through the building.</p>

<p>The hall was softly but sufficiently lighted by shaded lamps,
supported by huge figures in bronze, which diffused a charming
glow upon the innumerable pictures upon the panels of dark
oak. From the vaulted roof hung tattered flags, most of them
borne by the earlier Wyndwards, some of them bestowed by the
graceful hands of dead and gone princes; the somewhat gloomy
aspect of the place was lightened by the gleaming armor of the
knightly effigies which stood at regular intervals upon the tesselated
floor, and by the deep crimson of the curtains which screened
the heavy doors and tall windows. The whole scene, the very
atmosphere, as it seemed, was characteristic of an ancient and
powerful race. Notwithstanding that the house was full of
guests, and that a brilliant party was at that moment in the
drawing-room, not a sound penetrated the vast hall. The two
or three servants who were standing by the doors or sitting on
the benches, talking in hushed voices, were silent the moment
he entered, and one came forward to receive any commands.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the brusqueness which is the salient characteristic
of our present life, the old world state and formality still
existed at Wyndward. Be as exacting and capricious as you
might, you had no fear of meeting with inattention or disrespect
from the army of servants, whose one aim and purpose in life
seemed to be to minister to the wants and moods of their superiors.</p>

<p>It was a princely house, conducted in stately fashion, without
regard to cost or trouble, and the servants, from the pages to the
countess's own maid, were as proud of their position, in its
degree, as the Lord of Wyndward of his.</p>

<p>"Send Oliver to me," said Lord Wyndward, as he passed the
man. "I am going to my room."</p>

<p>He went up the stairs, and passing along the principal corridor,
entered a room fronting the park. It was one of a suite which
consisted of a sort of sitting-room, a dressing-room, and beyond
a bedroom.</p>

<p>The sitting-room gave pretty plain indications of the owner's
tastes and dispositions.</p>

<p>It was a medley of objects connected with sport and art.
Here a set of boxing-gloves and foils; a gun-rack, well stocked;
fishing-rods and whips hung over the antique fireplace with the
wide open hearth and dog-irons. On one side of the room hung
a collection of etchings, unique and priceless; on another half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
a dozen gems in oil, while against the third stood a piano, and
an easel upon which rested a canvas displaying a half-finished
Venus rising from her cradle of sea foam; for upon this, the
only son of the house, the partial gods had bestowed many gifts;
any one of which, had he been a poor man, would have made
the world regard him as one of its masters. But as it was, he
painted and played for amusement only, and there were only a
few of his friends, and only those who were most intimate, who
suspected that the wild, reckless Leycester could do more than
ride like a centaur and shoot like a North American Indian.
How were they to know, seeing that he rarely spoke of art, and
never of his own passionate love of it? Had they known, it
would have given them a key to much in his character which
puzzled and bewildered them; they would have been nearer
understanding how it was that in one man could be combined
the soft tenderness of a southern nature with the resolute, defiant
recklessness of the northern.</p>

<p>He entered the room and went to the fireplace in which a log
was burning brightly, to guard against the too frequent treachery
of an early summer evening, and flinging his hat on to a
chair, passed his hand through his hair with a thoughtful yet
restless smile.</p>

<p>"Stella!" he murmured. "Stella! That was wrong. A star
should be fair and golden, all light and sunshine, while she&mdash;great
Heaven! what eyes! It was surely the sweetest, loveliest
face that a man ever looked upon. No wonder that coming upon
it so suddenly&mdash;with my thoughts a hundred miles away,
coming upon it suddenly as it shone up above me&mdash;that I should
think it only a vision! If that face as I saw it could smile out
from the Academy next Spring, what crowds of fools would
gather round to gape and stare at it? If&mdash;yes, but who could do
it? No one! No one! As well try and catch the sunlight on a
brush and paint it on the canvas&mdash;as well try&mdash;&mdash;" he broke off
suddenly, his eye caught by the Venus Aphrodite smiling from
the easel, and going across to it, stood and contemplated it.</p>

<p>"Venus with a pale pink face and meaningless blue eyes, with
insipid yellow hair and simpering smile! Never more will
Venus take that semblance for me. No, she will be as I saw her
to-night, with dark silken hair, and sweeping lashes shading the
dark brown eyes, in which one sees the soul peering from their
depths. That is Venus, not this," and with a smile of derision
he took up a brush and drew a dark, broad effacing line across
the fair face.</p>

<p>"So departs forever all my former dreams of womanly loveliness.
Loveliness! I have never seen it until to-night. Stella!
A star! Yes, she is rightly named, after all. She shone down
on me like a star, and I&mdash;great Heaven!&mdash;was like one bewitched!
While she&mdash;she made a laughing-stock of me. Compared me
with the nag, and treated me like a school-boy too big to be
whipped but not too large to be laughed at.</p>

<p>"By Jove it is not a thing to be proud of; called to task by a
girl&mdash;a little slip of a girl not yet a woman! and yet I would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
have missed that laugh and the light scorn of those dark eyes,
though they lighted up at my expense. Stella&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door, and his valet, Oliver, entered.</p>

<p>Lord Leycester stared at him a moment abstractedly, then
roused himself from his reverie.</p>

<p>"What is it, Oliver?"</p>

<p>"You sent for me, my lord."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! I had forgotten. I will wash and get into my
other coat."</p>

<p>Oliver passed noiselessly into the other room and assisted his
master to change the velvet smoking-jacket for the dress coat,
brushed the thick, short-cut chestnut hair into order, and opened
the door.</p>

<p>"Where are they all?" he asked. "Are any of them in the
smoking-room?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord, Lord Barton and Captain Halliday; the Marquis
of Sandford and Sir William are in the billiard-room."</p>

<p>Lord Leycester nodded, and went down the stairs across the
hall; a servant drew a curtain aside and opened a door, and
Lord Leycester entered a small ante-room, one side of which
opened into a long-stretching fernery, from which came the soft
trip trip of fountains, and the breath which filled the whole
atmosphere with a tropical perfume.</p>

<p>A couple of footmen in gorgeous livery were standing beside
a double curtain, and at a sign from Lord Leycester they drew
it apart. Lord Leycester passed through and down a small corridor
lined with statuary, at the end of which was another curtain.
No passage, or door, or ante-room but was thus masked,
to shut out the two things which the earl held as abominations&mdash;draught
and noise.</p>

<p>With the opening of these curtains the large saloon was revealed
like the scene on the stage of a theater. It was a magnificent
room in keeping with the rest of the place, richly but
not gorgeously decorated, and lighted by wax candles shining
through faintly hued globes. At one end stood a grand piano in
white and ormolu, and a lady was playing and singing, while
others were standing round with tea-cups in their hands. Near
the fireplace was a table, upon which stood a silver tea equipage,
with which the countess was busied.</p>

<p>Lady Wyndward was still in her prime, notwithstanding that
Lord Leycester was twenty-three; she had been married at
eighteen, and was now in the perfection of matronly beauty; one
had only to glance at her to learn from whence Leycester had
got his strange beauty. Near her stood a tall, thin gentleman
with proud, haughty, clean-cut face, and iron gray hair, worn
rather long and brushed back from a white, lofty brow. It was
the earl. His dark piercing eyes were bent upon the ground as
he stood listening to the music, but he saw Leycester enter, and
raised his head as a slight frown crossed his face. Lady Wyndward
saw the frown and sought the cause, but her face showed
no signs of surprise or displeasure. It was calm and impassive
at all times, as if its owner disdained the weakness of ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
mortals. Leycester paused a moment, taking in the scene; then
he crossed the room, and went up to the table.</p>

<p>Lady Wyndward looked up with her serene, imperial smile.</p>

<p>"Will you have some tea, Leycester?"</p>

<p>"Thanks," he said.</p>

<p>She gave him his cup, and as he took it a young man left the
group at the piano, and came up to him laughing.</p>

<p>"Where have you been, Leycester?" he asked, putting his
hand on the broad shoulder. It was Lord Charles Guildford,
Leycester's most intimate friend.</p>

<p>Between these two existed an affection which was almost, say
rather more than fraternal. They had been together at Eton,
where Leycester, the great, stalwart lad, had fought the slight
frail boy's battles; they had lived in the same rooms at Oxford,
had been comrades in all the wild escapades which made their
term at college a notorious one, and they were inseparable.
Leycester had grown from a tall lad into a stalwart man; Lord
Charles&mdash;or Charlie, as he was called&mdash;had fulfilled the promise
of his frail boyhood, and developed into a slight, thin, fair-haired
youth, with the indolent grace which sometimes accompanies
weakness, and the gentle nature of a woman.</p>

<p>Leycester turned to him with a smile, and the earl looked up
to hear the answer; the countess busied herself with the teapot,
as if she were not listening as intently.</p>

<p>"I went for a galop, Charlie," said Leycester. "You fellows
were half asleep in the smoking-room, and I had listened to
Barton's Indian story for the hundredth time, and it got rather
slow; then I remembered that the chestnut had been eating his
head off for the last five weeks, and thought I would give him a
turn."</p>

<p>The earl frowned and turned away; Lord Charles laughed.</p>

<p>"Pretty behavior!" he exclaimed; "and here were we hunting
all over the place for you."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you come into the drawing-room to us, Lord
Leycester?" said a beautiful girl who was sitting near; "we
should not have bored you with any Indian stories."</p>

<p>"But, you see, I should have bored you, Lady Constance," he
said.</p>

<p>The girl smiled up into his face.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you would," she said. "You are more considerate
than I thought."</p>

<p>"I never venture into the ladies' sanctum after dinner till the
tea is announced," he retorted. "I have an idea, shared by my
sex generally, that it is not safe&mdash;that, in short, you are too
ferocious."</p>

<p>"And you prefer riding about the country till we quiet down.
Are we quiet now, or do we look ferocious?"</p>

<p>And she smiled up at him from behind her fan with a plain
invitation.</p>

<p>He sat down beside her and began to talk the infinite nothings
which came to his lips so easily, the trivial small change which
his musical voice and rare smile seemed to transform to true
coin; but while he talked his thoughts were wandering to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
dark-haired girl who had shone down upon him from her green
and fragrant bower in the lane, and he found himself picturing
her in the little room at the cottage in the meadows, amongst
the curious litter of the old artist's studio; and gradually his
answers grew disjointed and inconsequential.</p>

<p>He got up presently, got up abruptly, and wandered across the
room stopping to exchange a word or two with one and the
other, his tall, graceful figure towering above those of the other
men, his handsome head thrown back musingly. Many an admiring
and wistful glance followed him from among the
women, and not a few would have exerted all their fascinations
to keep him by their side, had they not known by experience,
that when he was in his present mood he was deaf to the voice
and smile of the charmer, charmed she never so wisely.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> countess watched him from her table, and, looking up at
the earl, murmured:</p>

<p>"Leycester is in one of his restless moods to-night."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, with a sigh. "What is it?&mdash;do you know?"</p>

<p>"No," she said, calmly. "He was all right at dinner."</p>

<p>"Why can he not behave like other people?" said the earl,
sadly. "Can you fancy any other man leaving his father's
guests and riding about the country?"</p>

<p>"Leycester never was like any other," she said, not without a
touch of pride. "He is as he is, and nothing can alter him."</p>

<p>The earl was silent for a moment, his long white hands folded
behind his back, his dark eyes fixed on the floor.</p>

<p>"Has he told you of his last escapade&mdash;his last mad freak?" he
said, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, calmly. "He has never concealed anything
from me."</p>

<p>"It is nearly twenty thousand pounds. Even Wyndward
must feel such strains as this."</p>

<p>The countess raised her head.</p>

<p>"I know," she said; "he has told me everything. It was a
point of honor. I did not quite understand; horse-racing is a
pastime with which I have little sympathy, though we have
always owned race-horses. It was a point of honor. Some one
had been taking advantage of his name to act dishonestly, and
he withdrew the horse. He could take no other course," he says.</p>

<p>The earl sighed.</p>

<p>"No doubt. But it is mad folly, and there is no end to it&mdash;if
he could see some limit! Why does he not marry?"</p>

<p>The countess glanced at the handsome face.</p>

<p>"He will not marry until he meets with some one he can
love."</p>

<p>The earl looked round the room at the many beautiful graceful
women who adorned it, and sighed impatiently.</p>

<p>"He is hard to please."</p>

<p>"He is," assented the countess, with the same touch of pride.</p>

<p>"It is time he married and settled," continued the earl. "For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
most men a year or two would not matter, but with him&mdash;I do
not like to think that the title rests only on our two lives, as
mine must be near its close."</p>

<p>"Algernon!"</p>

<p>"And on his, which is risked daily."</p>

<p>He stooped, silenced by the sudden look of pain in the beautiful
eyes.</p>

<p>"Why do you not speak to him? He will do anything for
you."</p>

<p>The countess smiled.</p>

<p>"Everything but that. No, I cannot speak to him; it would
be useless. I do not wish to weaken my influence."</p>

<p>"Get Lilian to speak to him," he said.</p>

<p>The countess sighed.</p>

<p>"Lilian!" she murmured; "she would not do it. She thinks
him something more than human, and that no woman in the
world can be good enough to&mdash;to hold his stirrup or fill his wineglass."</p>

<p>The earl frowned.</p>

<p>"Between you," he said, "you have spoiled him."</p>

<p>The countess shook her head gently.</p>

<p>"No, we have not. He is now as a man what he was as a boy.
Do you remember what Nelson said, when Hardy asked him
why he did nothing while one of their ships was fighting two of
the enemy's? 'I am doing all I can&mdash;watching.'"</p>

<p>Before the earl could reply, a cabinet minister came up and
engaged him in conversation, and the countess rose and crossed
the room to where an elderly lady sat with a portfolio of engravings
before her. It was the Dowager Countess of Longford,
a tiny little woman with a thin wrinkled face, and keen but
kindly gray eyes that lit up her white face and made it remarkable.</p>

<p>She was dressed as simply as a quakeress, excepting for some
old and priceless lace which softened the rigor of her plainly
made gray satin dress. She looked up as the younger countess
approached, and made room for her on the sofa.</p>

<p>Lady Wyndward sat down in silence, which was unbroken
for a minute. Then the old countess said without looking at
her&mdash;</p>

<p>"The boy grows handsomer every day, Ethel!"</p>

<p>Lady Wyndward sighed.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" asked the other, with a keen smile.
"What has he been doing now, burning a church or running off
with a Lord Mayor's daughter?"</p>

<p>"He has not been doing anything very much," answered Lady
Wyndward. "Except losing some money."</p>

<p>The old countess raised her eyebrows lightly.</p>

<p>"That does not matter."</p>

<p>"Not much. No, he has not been doing anything; I wish he
would. That's what is the matter."</p>

<p>"I understand," retorted the other. "He is most dangerous
when quiet; you are always afraid he is preparing for some
piece of madness beyond the ordinary. Well, my dear, if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
will give the world such a creature you must put up with the
consequences&mdash;be prepared to pay the penalty. I should be quite
content to do so."</p>

<p>"Ah, you don't know," said the countess, with a smile that
had something pathetic in it.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do," retorted the old lady, curtly. "And I envy you
still. I love the boy, Ethel. There is not a woman of us in the
room, from the youngest to the oldest, who does not love him.
You cannot expect one whom the gods have so favored to behave
like an ordinary mortal."</p>

<p>"Why not? It is just what Algernon has said to me."</p>

<p>"I thought as much. I was watching you two. Of all things,
beware of this: don't let Algernon interfere with him. It is a
strange thing to say, but his father is the worst man in all the
world to attempt to put the bridle on Leycester. It is we women
who alone have the power to guide him."</p>

<p>"That is where my fear lies," said the countess. "It is the
thought of what may happen in that quarter which fills me with
daily dread."</p>

<p>"There is only one safeguard&mdash;marry him," remarked the old
countess, but with a comical smile.</p>

<p>The countess sighed.</p>

<p>"Again, that is what Algernon says. You both say it as
calmly as if you told me to give him a cup of tea."</p>

<p>The old countess was silent for a moment, then she said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Where is Lenore Beauchamp?"</p>

<p>Lady Wyndward was almost guilty of a start.</p>

<p>"You read my thoughts," she said.</p>

<p>The old lady nodded.</p>

<p>"She is the only woman who can really touch him. Ask her
here; let them be together. She will be glad to come."</p>

<p>"I am not sure, Lenore is proud; she might guess why we
wanted her."</p>

<p>The old lady drew up her head as haughtily as if she was
Leycester's mother.</p>

<p>"And then? Is there any girl among them who would not
jump at the chance? I don't mean because he is the heir to
Wyndward; he is enough in himself without that."</p>

<p>"It is well you are not his mother; you would have made him
what he is not now&mdash;vain."</p>

<p>The old lady sighed.</p>

<p>"I know it. But you are wrong about Lenore. If she ever
cared for anyone, it is Leycester. She is proud, but love levels
pride, and she may put forth her power. If she should, not even
Leycester can withstand her. Ask her down, and leave the rest
to her&mdash;and Providence."</p>

<p>The countess sat for a moment in silence, then she put her
hand upon the thin, wrinkled hand, unadorned by a single gem.</p>

<p>"I have always you to come to. I think you understand him
better than his own mother."</p>

<p>"No," said the old lady, "but I love him nearly as well."</p>

<p>"I will write at once," said the countess. And she rose and
crossed to the ante-room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a writing-table amongst the furniture; the servants
saw her go to it, and noiselessly left the room.</p>

<p>She took up the pen and thought a moment, then wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Lenore</span>,&mdash;Will you come down and spend a week
with us? We have a few friends with us, but we are not complete
without you. Do not say 'No,' but come. I do not name
any day, so that you may be free to fix your own."</p>

<p>
"Yours affectionately,<br />
<br />
"<span class="smcap">Ethel Wyndward</span>."<br />
</p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;Leycester is with us."</p></blockquote>

<p>As she wrote the signature she heard a step behind her, which
she knew was Leycester's.</p>

<p>He stopped short as he saw her, and coming up to her, put his
hand on her white shoulder.</p>

<p>"Writing, mother?" he said.</p>

<p>The countess folded her letter.</p>

<p>"Yes. Where are you going?"</p>

<p>He pointed to the Louis Quatorze clock that ticked solemnly
on a bracket.</p>

<p>"Ten o'clock, mother," he said, with a smile.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; I see," she assented.</p>

<p>He stood for a moment looking down at her with all a young
man's filial pride in a mother's beauty, and, bending down,
touched her cheek with his lips, then passed out.</p>

<p>The countess looked after him with softened eyes.</p>

<p>"Who could help loving him?" she murmured.</p>

<p>Humming an air from the last opera bouffe, he ran lightly up
the staircase and passed along the corridor, but as he reached
the further end and knocked at a door, the light air died upon
his lips.</p>

<p>A low voice murmured, "Come in;" and opening the door
gently, he entered.</p>

<p>The room was a small one, and luxuriously furnished in a
rather strange style. On the first entrance, a stranger would
have been struck by the soft and delicate tints which pervaded
throughout. There was not a brilliant color in the apartment;
the carpet and hangings, the furniture, the pictures themselves
were all of a reposeful tint, which could not tire the eye or
weary the sense. The carpet was a thick Persian rug, which
deadened the sound of footsteps, costly hangings of a cool and
restful gray covered the walls, save at intervals; the fire itself
was screened by a semi-transparent screen, and the only light in
the room came from a lamp which was suspended by a silver
chain from the ceiling, and was covered by a thick shade.</p>

<p>On a couch placed by the window reclined a young girl. As
Leycester entered, she half rose and turned a pale, but beautiful
face toward him with an expectant smile.</p>

<p>Beautiful is a word that is easily written, and written so often
that its significance has got dulled: it fails to convey any idea
of the ethereal loveliness of Lilian Wyndward. Had Mr.
Etheridge painted a face with Leycester's eyes, and given it the
delicately-cut lips and spiritual expression of one of Raphael's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
angels, it would have been a fair representation of Lilian Wyndward.</p>

<p>"It is you Leycester," she said. "I knew you would come,"
and she pointed to a small traveling clock that stood on a table
near her.</p>

<p>He went up to her and kissed her, and she put her arms round
his neck and laid her face against his, her eyes looking into his
with rapt devotion.</p>

<p>"How hot you are, dear. Is it hot down there?"</p>

<p>"Awfully," he said, seating himself beside her, and thrusting
his hands into his pockets. "There is not a breath of air
moving, and if there were the governor would take care to shut
it out. This room is deliriously cool, Lil; it is a treat to come
into it."</p>

<p>"Is it?" she said, with a glad eagerness. "You really think
it is. I like to hear you say that."</p>

<p>"Yes, it's the prettiest room in the house. What is it smells
so sweet?"</p>

<p>"Lilac," she said, and she pointed to a bunch on the table.</p>

<p>He started slightly, and, stretching out his hand, took a spray
out of the epergne.</p>

<p>"I thought it was lilac," he said, quietly. "I noticed it when
I came in."</p>

<p>She took the spray from him and fastened it in his coat, against
which her hands looked white as the driven snow.</p>

<p>"You shall take it to your own room, Ley," she said. "You
shall take them all."</p>

<p>"Not for worlds, Lil," he said. "This will do."</p>

<p>"And what are they doing?" she asked.</p>

<p>"The usual thing," he replied; "playing, singing, rubber at
whist, and boring each other to death generally."</p>

<p>She smiled.</p>

<p>"And what have you been doing?"</p>

<p>"Assisting in the latter amusement," he answered, lightly.</p>

<p>"They told me you had gone out," she said.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes, I took the chestnut for a spin."</p>

<p>She laughed, a soft, hushed laugh.</p>

<p>"And left them the first night! That was like you, Ley!"</p>

<p>"What was the use of staying? It was wrong, I suppose. I
am unfortunate! Yes, I went for a ride."</p>

<p>"It was a lovely evening. I watched the sunset," and she
looked at the window. "If I had known you were going, I
would have looked for you. I like to see you riding that big
chestnut. You went across the meadows?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "across the meadows."</p>

<p>He was silent for a minute, then he said, suddenly, "Lil, I
have seen a vision to-night."</p>

<p>"A vision, Ley!" she repeated, looking up at him eagerly.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"A vision. The most beautiful girl I have ever seen, excepting
you, Lil!"</p>

<p>She made no protest, but smiled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ley! A girl! What was she like?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell you," he said. "I came upon her in a moment.
The chestnut saw her first, and was human enough to be struck
motionless. I was struck too!"</p>

<p>"And you can't tell me what she was like?"</p>

<p>"No; if I were to describe her with usual phrases you would
smile. You women always do. You can't help being a woman,
Lil!"</p>

<p>"Was she dark or fair?"</p>

<p>"Dark," he replied. "I did not know it at the time; it was
impossible to think whether she was dark or fair while one looked
at her, but I remembered afterward. Lil, you remember that picture
I sent you from Paris&mdash;the picture of the girl with the dark
eyes and long, silky hair&mdash;not black, but brown in the
sunlight, with long lashes shading the eyes, and the lips curved
in a half-serious smile as she looks down at the dog fawning at
her feet?"</p>

<p>"I remember, Ley. Was she like that?"</p>

<p>"Yes; only alive. Fancy the girl in the picture alive. Fancy
yourself the dog she was smiling at! I was the dog!"</p>

<p>"Ley!"</p>

<p>"And she spoke as well as smiled. You can imagine the voice
that girl in the picture would have. Soft and musical, but clear
as a bell and full of a subtle kind of witchery, half serious, half
mockery. It was the voice of the girl I met in the lane this
evening."</p>

<p>"Ley! Ley, you have come to make poetry to me to-night. I
am very grateful."</p>

<p>"Poetry! It is truth. But you are right; such a face, such a
voice would make a poet of the hardest man that lives."</p>

<p>"And you are not hard, Ley! But the girl! Who is she?
What is her name?"</p>

<p>"Her name"&mdash;he hesitated a moment, and his voice unconsciously
grew wonderfully musical&mdash;"is Stella&mdash;Stella."</p>

<p>"Stella!" she repeated. "It is a beautiful name."</p>

<p>"Is it not? Stella!"</p>

<p>"And she is&mdash;who?"</p>

<p>"The niece of old Etheridge, the artist, at the cottage."</p>

<p>Lilian's eyes opened wide.</p>

<p>"Really, Ley, I must see her!"</p>

<p>His face flushed, and he looked at her.</p>

<p>She caught the eager look, and her own paled suddenly.</p>

<p>"No," she said, gravely. "I will not see her. Ley&mdash;you will forget
her by to-morrow."</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>"You will forget her by to-morrow. Ley, let me look at you!"</p>

<p>He turned his face to her, and she looked straight into his eyes,
then she put her arm round his neck.</p>

<p>"Oh, Ley! has it come at last?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he asked, not angrily, but with a touch
of grimness, as if he were afraid of the answer.</p>

<p>"Ley," she said, "you must not see her again. Ley, you will
go to-morrow, will you not?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why?" he asked. "It is not like you to send me away,
Lil."</p>

<p>"No, but I do. I who look forward to seeing you as the
sweetest thing in my life&mdash;I who would rather have you near
me than be&mdash;other than I am&mdash;I who lie and wait and listen for
your footsteps&mdash;I send you, Ley. Think! You must go, Ley.
Go at once, for your own sake and for hers."</p>

<p>He rose, and smiled down at her.</p>

<p>"For my sake, perhaps, but not for hers. You foolish girl, do
you think all your sex is as partial as you are? You did not see
her as I saw her to-night&mdash;did not hear her ready wit at my expense.
For her sake! You make me smile, Lil."</p>

<p>"I cannot smile, Ley. You will not stay! What good can
come of it? I know you so well. You will not be content until
you have seen your Venus again, and then&mdash;ah, Ley, what can
she do but love you, and love you but to lose you? Ley, all that
has gone before has made me smile, because with them I knew
you were heart-whole; I could look into your eyes and see the
light of laughter in their depths; but not this time, Ley&mdash;not
this time. You must go. Promise me!"</p>

<p>His face went pale under her gaze, and the defiant look, which
so rarely shone out in her presence, came into his eyes, and about
his lips.</p>

<p>"I cannot promise, Lil," he said.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2 style="margin-top: 3em;"><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

<p style="margin-left: 28%; margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 2em;">&nbsp;&nbsp;For love lay lurking in the clouds and mist,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard him singing sweetly on the mountain side:<br />
"'Tis all in vain you fly, for everywhere am I&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In every quiet valley, on every mountain side!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the clear, bird-like tones of Stella's voice the musical words
floated from the open window of her room above and through
the open French windows of the old man's studio.</p>

<p>With a little start he turned his head away from the easel and
looked toward the door.</p>

<p>Stella had only been in the house three days, but he had already
learned something of her habits, and knew that when he heard
the beautiful voice singing at the window in the early morning,
he might expect to see the owner of the voice enter shortly.</p>

<p>His expectation was not doomed to disappointment. The voice
sounded on the stairs, in the hall, and a moment afterward the
door opened and Stella stood looking smilingly into the room.</p>

<p>If he had thought her beautiful and winsome on that first
evening of her coming, when she was weary with anxiety and
traveling, and dressed in dust-stained clothes, be sure he thought
her more beautiful still, now that the light heart felt free to reveal
itself, and the shabby dress had given place to the white
and simple but still graceful morning gown.</p>

<p>Mrs. Penfold had worked hard during those three days, and
with the aid of the Dulverfield milliner had succeeded in filling
a small wardrobe for "her young lady," as she had learned to
call her. The old artist, ignorant of the power of women in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
such direction, had watched the transformation with inward
amazement and delight, and was never tired of hearing about
dresses, and hats, jackets, and capes, and was rather disappointed
than otherwise when he found that the grand transformation
had been effected at a very small cost.</p>

<p>Bright and beautiful she stood, like a vision of youth and
health in the doorway, her dark eyes laughingly contemplating
the old man's gentle stare of wonder,&mdash;the look which always
came into his eyes when she appeared.</p>

<p>"Did I disturb you by my piping, uncle?" she asked as she
kissed him.</p>

<p>"Oh no, my dear," he answered, "I like to hear you,&mdash;I like
to hear you."</p>

<p>She leant against his shoulder, and looked at his work.</p>

<p>"How beautiful it is!" she murmured. "How quickly it
grows. I heard you come down this morning, and I meant to
get up, but I was so tired&mdash;lazy, wasn't I?"</p>

<p>"No, no!" he said, eagerly. "I am sorry I disturbed you. I
came down as quietly as I could. I knew you would be tired
after your dissipation. You must tell me all about it."</p>

<p>"Yes, come to breakfast and I will tell you."</p>

<p>"Must I?" he said, glancing at his picture reluctantly.</p>

<p>He had been in the habit of eating his breakfast by installments,
painting while he ate a mouthful and drank his cup of
coffee, but Stella insisted upon his changing what she called a
very wicked habit.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course! See how nice it looks," and she drew him
gently to the table and forced him into a chair.</p>

<p>The old man submitted with a sigh that was not altogether
one of regret, and still humming she sat opposite the urn and
began to fill the cups.</p>

<p>"And did you enjoy yourself?" he asked, gazing at her
dreamily.</p>

<p>"Oh, very much; they were so kind. Mrs. Hamilton is the
dearest old lady; and the doctor&mdash;what makes him smile so
much, uncle?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I think doctors generally do."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well. Well, he was very kind too, and so were the
Miss Hamiltons. It was very nice indeed, and they took so
much notice of me&mdash;asked me all sorts of questions. Sometimes
I scarcely knew what to answer. I think they thought
because I had been brought up in Italy, I ought to have spoken
with a strong accent, and looked utterly different to themselves.
I think they were a little disappointed, uncle."</p>

<p>"Oh," he said, "and who else was there?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the clergyman, Mr. Fielding&mdash;a very solemn gentleman
indeed. He said he didn't see much of you, and hoped he
should see me in church."</p>

<p>Mr. Etheridge rubbed his head and looked rather guilty.</p>

<p>"I expect that was a back-handed knock for me, Stella," he
said rather ruefully. "You see I don't go to church often. I
always mean to go, but I generally forget the time, or I wander<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
into the fields, or up into the woods, and forget all about the
church till it's too late."</p>

<p>"But that's very wicked, abominably so," said Stella, gravely,
but with a twinkle in her dark eyes. "I must look after your
morals as well as your meals, I see, uncle."</p>

<p>"Yes," he assented, meekly&mdash;"do, do."</p>

<p>"Well, then there was a Mr. Adelstone, a young gentleman
from London. He was quite the lion of the evening. I think
he was a nephew of Mr. Fielding's."</p>

<p>The old man nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes; and did you like him?"</p>

<p>Stella thought a moment, holding the cream-jug critically over
the coffee-cup.</p>

<p>"Not much, uncle. It was very wrong, and very bad taste,
I am afraid, for they all seemed to admire him immensely, and
so did he himself."</p>

<p>Mr. Etheridge looked at her rather alarmed.</p>

<p>"I must say, Stella, you get too critical. I don't think we are
quite used to it."</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>"I don't fancy Mr. Adelstone was at all conscious of adverse
criticism; he seemed quite satisfied with everybody, himself in
particular. He certainly was beautifully dressed, and he had the
dearest little hands and feet in the world; and his hair was
parted to a hair, and as smooth as a black-and-tan terrier's; so
that he had some grounds for satisfaction."</p>

<p>"What did he do to offend you, Stella?" asked the old man,
rather shrewdly.</p>

<p>She laughed again, and a little touch of color came into her
face, but she answered quite frankly:</p>

<p>"He paid me compliments, uncle."</p>

<p>"That doesn't offend your sex generally, Stella."</p>

<p>"It offends me," said Stella, quickly. "I&mdash;I detest them!
especially when the man who pays them does it with a self-satisfied
smile which shows that he is thinking more of his own
eloquence and gallantry than of the person he is flattering."</p>

<p>The old man looked at her.</p>

<p>"Will you oblige me by telling me your age again?" he said.</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>"Am I too wise, uncle? Well, never mind&mdash;I'll promise to be
good and stupid, if you like. But you are not eating any breakfast;
and you must not keep looking at that odious easel all the
time, as if you were longing to get back to it. Did you ever see
a jealous woman?"</p>

<p>"No, never."</p>

<p>"Well, if you don't want to, you must not confine all your attention
to your work."</p>

<p>"I don't think there is much fear of that when you are near,"
he said, meekly.</p>

<p>She laughed, and jumped up to kiss him with delight.</p>

<p>"Now that was a splendid compliment, sir! You are improving
rapidly&mdash;Mr. Adelstone himself couldn't have done it more
neatly."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>Scarcely had the words left her lips than the door opened.</p>

<p>"Mr. Adelstone," said Mrs. Penfold.</p>

<p>A young man, tall and dark, and faultlessly dressed, stood in
the doorway, his hat in one hand, a bouquet of flowers in the
other. He was undeniably good-looking, and as he stood with a
smile upon his face, looked at his best. A severe critic might
have found fault with his eyes, and said that they were a little
too small and a little too near together, might also have added
that they were rather shifty, and that there was something approaching
the sinister in the curves of the thin lips; but he was
undeniably good-looking, and notwithstanding his well cut
clothes and spotless boots with their gray gaiters, his white hands
with the choice selection of rings, there was an indication of
power about him; no one could have suspected him of being a
fool, or lacking the power of observation; for instance, as he
stood now, smiling and waiting for a welcome, his dark eyes
took in every detail of the room without appearing to leave
Stella's face.</p>

<p>Mr. Etheridge looked up with the usual confused air with
which he always received his rare visitors, but Stella held out
her hand with a smile calm and self-possessed. There is a great
deal of the woman even about a girl of nineteen.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Mr. Adelstone," she said. "You have come
just in time for a cup of coffee."</p>

<p>"I ought to apologize for intruding at such an unseasonable
hour," he said, as he bent over her hand, "but your good housekeeper
would not hear of my going without paying my respects.
I am afraid I'm intruding."</p>

<p>"Not at all, not at all," murmured the artist. "Here's a
chair," and he rose and cleared a chair of its litter by the simple
process of sweeping it on to the floor.</p>

<p>Mr. Adelstone sat down.</p>

<p>"I hope you are not tired after your mild dissipation last
night?" he asked of Stella.</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>"Not at all. I was telling uncle how nice it was. It was my
first party in England, you know."</p>

<p>"Oh, you musn't call it a party," he said. "But I am very
glad you enjoyed it."</p>

<p>"What beautiful flowers," said Stella, glancing at the bouquet.</p>

<p>He handed them to her.</p>

<p>"Will you be so kind as to accept them?" he said. "I heard
you admire them in the conservatory last night and I brought
them for you from the rectory green-house."</p>

<p>"For me?" exclaimed Stella, open-eyed. "Oh, I didn't know!
I am so sorry you should have troubled. It was very kind.
You must have robbed the poor plants terribly."</p>

<p>"They would be quite consoled if they could know for whom
their blossoms were intended," he said, with a low bow.</p>

<p>Stella looked at him with a smile, and glanced half archly at
her uncle.</p>

<p>"That was very nice," she said. "Poor flowers! it is a pity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
they can't know! Can't you tell them? There is a language of
flowers, you know!"</p>

<p>Mr. Adelstone smiled. He was not accustomed to have his
compliments met with such ready wit, and was nonplussed for a
moment, while his eyes dropped from her face with a little
shifty look.</p>

<p>Mr. Etheridge broke the rather embarrassing pause.</p>

<p>"Put them in the vase for her, Mr. Adelstone, will you,
please, and come and have some breakfast. You can't have had
any."</p>

<p>He waited until Stella echoed the invitation, then drew up to
the table.</p>

<p>Stella rang for cup and saucer and plates, and poured him out
some coffee; and he plunged into small talk with the greatest
ease, his keen eyes watching every graceful turn of Stella's arm,
and glancing now and again at the beautiful face.</p>

<p>It was very good small talk, and amusing. Mr. Adelstone was
one of those men who had seen everything. He talked of the
London season that was just coming on, to Stella, who sat and
listened, half amused, half puzzled, for London was an unknown
land to her, and the string of names, noble and fashionable,
which fell from his ready tongue, was entirely strange to her.</p>

<p>Then he talked of the coming Academy to Mr. Etheridge, and
seemed to know all about the pictures that were going to be exhibited,
and which ones would make a stir, and which would
fail. Then he addressed himself to Stella again.</p>

<p>"You must pay London a visit, Miss Etheridge; there is no
place like it the whole world through&mdash;not even Paris or
Rome."</p>

<p>Stella smiled.</p>

<p>"It is not very likely that I shall see London for a long time.
My uncle does not often go, although it is so near, do you?"</p>

<p>"No, no," he assented, "not often."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are to be congratulated," said Mr. Adelstone.
"With all its charms, I am glad to get away from it."</p>

<p>"You live there?" said Stella.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, quietly, welcoming the faint look of interest
in her eyes. "Yes; I live in chambers, as it is called, in one of
the old law inns. I am a lawyer!"</p>

<p>Stella nodded.</p>

<p>"I know. You wear a long black gown and a wig."</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>"And address a jury; and do you say 'm'lud' instead of 'my
lord,' as people in novels always make barristers say?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; perhaps I do," he answered, with a smile;
"but I don't address a jury, or have an opportunity of calling a
judge 'my lud,' or 'my lord,' often. Most of my work is done
at my chambers. I am very glad to get down into the country
for a holiday."</p>

<p>"Are you going to stay long?" asked Mr. Etheridge, with
polite interest.</p>

<p>Mr. Adelstone paused a moment, and glanced at Stella before
answering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know," he said. "I meant going back to-day, but&mdash;I
think I have changed my mind."</p>

<p>Stella was only half listening, but the words caused her to
start. They were the same as those which Lord Leycester had
uttered three nights ago.</p>

<p>Mr. Adelstone's keen eyes saw the start, and he made a mental
note of it.</p>

<p>"Ah! it is beautiful weather," said Mr. Etheridge. "It would
be a pity to leave Wyndward for London now."</p>

<p>"Yes: I shall be more than ever sorry to go now," said Mr.
Adelstone, and his glance rested for a moment on Stella's face,
but it was quite lost, for Stella's eyes were fixed on the scene beyond
the window dreamily.</p>

<p>With almost a start she turned to him.</p>

<p>"Let me give you some more coffee!"</p>

<p>"No, thanks," he said; then, as Stella rose and rang the bell,
he walked to the easel. "That will be a beautiful picture, Mr.
Etheridge," he said, viewing it with a critical air.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said the artist, simply.</p>

<p>"You will exhibit it?"</p>

<p>"I never exhibit anything," was the quiet reply.</p>

<p>"No! I am surprised!" exclaimed the young man, but there
was something in the quiet manner of the old man that stopped
any further questions.</p>

<p>"No," said Mr. Etheridge; "why should I? I have"&mdash;and
he smiled&mdash;"no ambition. Besides I am an old man, I have had
my chance; let the young ones take theirs, I leave them room.
You are fond of art?"</p>

<p>"Very," said Mr. Adelstone. "May I look round?"</p>

<p>The old man waved his hand, and took up his brush.</p>

<p>Jasper Adelstone wandered round the room, taking up the
canvases and examining them; Stella stood at the window humming
softly.</p>

<p>Suddenly she heard him utter an involuntary exclamation, and
turning round saw that he had the portrait of Lord Leycester in
his hand.</p>

<p>His face was turned toward her, and as she turned quickly,
he was in time to catch a sinister frown of dislike, which rested
for a moment on his face, but vanished as he raised his eyes and
met hers.</p>

<p>"Lord Leycester," he said, with a smile and an uprising of the
eyebrows. "A remarkable instance of an artist's power."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Stella, quietly, but with lowered
eyes.</p>

<p>"I mean that it is a fair example of ideality. Mr. Etheridge
has painted a likeness of Lord Leycester, and added an ideal
poetry of his own."</p>

<p>"You mean that it is not like him?" she said.</p>

<p>Mr. Etheridge painted on, deaf to both of them.</p>

<p>"No," he said, looking at the picture with a cold smile. "It
is like him, but it&mdash;honors him. It endows him with a poetry
which he does not possess."</p>

<p>"You know him?" said Stella.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who does not?" he answered, and his thin lips curled with a
smiling sneer.</p>

<p>A faint color came into Stella's face, and she raised her eyes
for a moment.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean that Lord Leycester has made himself too famous&mdash;I
was going to say infamous&mdash;"</p>

<p>A vivid crimson rushed to her face, and left it pale again the
next instant.</p>

<p>"Do not," she said, then added quickly, "I mean do not forget
that he is not here to defend himself."</p>

<p>He looked at her with a sinister scrutiny.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon. I did not know he was a friend of
yours," he said.</p>

<p>She raised her eyes and looked at him steadily.</p>

<p>"Lord Leycester is no friend of mine," she said, quietly.</p>

<p>"I am glad of it," he responded.</p>

<p>Stella's eyes darkened and deepened in a way peculiar to her,
and her color came. It was true that Lord Leycester was no
friend of hers, she had but seen and spoken with him by chance,
and for a few moments; but who was this Mr. Adelstone that
he should presume to be glad or sorry on her account?</p>

<p>He was quick to see that he had made a slip, and quick to recover
himself.</p>

<p>"Pray forgive me if I have presumed too far upon our slight
acquaintance, but I was only thinking at that moment that you
had been so short a time in England as to be ignorant of people
who are well known to us with whom they have lived, and that
you would not know Lord Leycester's real character."</p>

<p>Stella inclined her head gravely. Something within her stirred
her to take up arms in the absent man's defense; the one word
"infamous," stuck and rankled in her mind.</p>

<p>"You said that Lord Leycester was 'infamous,'" she said, with
a grave smile. "Surely that is too strong a word."</p>

<p>He thought a moment, his eyes resting on her face keenly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, but I am not sure. I certainly used it as a play
upon the word 'famous,' but I don't think even then that I did
him an injustice. A man whose name is known all over the
country&mdash;whose name is familiar as a household word&mdash;must
be notorious either for good or evil, for wisdom or folly. Lord
Leycester is not famous for virtue or wisdom. I cannot say
any more."</p>

<p>Stella turned aside, a faint crimson dyeing her face, a strange
thrill of pity, ay, and of impatience, at her heart. Why
should he be so wicked, so mad and reckless&mdash;so notorious that
even this self-satisfied young gentleman could safely moralize
about him and warn her against making his acquaintance!
"Oh, the pity of it&mdash;the pity of it!" as Shakespeare has it&mdash;that
one with such a beautiful, god-look face, should be so bad.</p>

<p>There was a few moments' silence. Jasper Adelstone still
stood with the picture in his hand, but glancing at Stella's face
with covert watchfulness. For all his outward calmness, his heart
was beating quickly. Stella's was the sort of beauty to make a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
man's heart beat quickly, or not at all; those who came to offer
at her shrine would offer no half-measured oblations. As he
watched her his heart beat wildly, and his small, bright eyes
glittered. He had thought her beautiful at the party last night,
where she had outshone all the other girls of the village as a star
outshines a rushlight; but this morning her loveliness revealed
itself in all its fresh purity, and he&mdash;Jasper Adelstone, the critical
man of the world, the man whose opinion about women
was looked upon by his companions in Lincoln's-inn and the
bachelors' haunts at the West-end as worth having&mdash;felt his
heart slipping from him. He put the picture down and approached
her.</p>

<p>"You have no idea how beautiful and fresh the meadows are.
Will you stroll down to the river with me?" he said, resolving
to take her by surprise and capture her.</p>

<p>But he did not know Stella. She was only a school-girl&mdash;innocent
and ignorant of the ways of men and the world; but,
perhaps, because of that&mdash;because she had not learnt the usual
hackneyed words of evasion&mdash;the ordinary elementary tactics of
flirtation, she was not to be taken by surprise.</p>

<p>With a smile she turned her eyes upon him and shook her
head.</p>

<p>"Thank you; no, that is impossible. I have all my household
duties to perform, and that"&mdash;pointing to the sun with
her white slim hand&mdash;"reminds me that it is time I set about
them."</p>

<p>He took up his hat instantly, turning to hide the frown that
knitted his brow and spoiled his face, and went up to the painter
to say "good-morning."</p>

<p>Mr. Etheridge started and stared at him; he had quite forgotten
his presence.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, good-morning&mdash;going? I beg your pardon.
Won't you stop and take some tea with us?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Adelstone would like some dinner first, uncle," said
Stella.</p>

<p>Then she gave him her hand.</p>

<p>"Good-morning," she said, "and thank you very much for
the flowers."</p>

<p>He held her hand as long as he dared, then passed out.</p>

<p>Stella, perhaps unconsciously, gave a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"Very nice young fellow, my dear," said Mr. Etheridge, without
taking his eyes from the canvas. "Very clever, too. I remember
him quite a little boy, and always said he would make
his way. They say that he has done so. I am not surprised.
Jasper&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Jasper!" said Stella. "What a horrible name."</p>

<p>"Eh? Horrible? I don't know&mdash;I don't know."</p>

<p>"But I do," said Stella, laughing. "Well, what were you
going to say?"</p>

<p>"That Jasper Adelstone is the sort of man to insist upon
having anything he sets his heart upon."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear it," said Stella, as she opened the door,
"for his sake; and I hope, also for his sake, that he won't set his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
mind upon the sun or the moon!" and with a laugh she ran
away.</p>

<p>In the kitchen Mrs. Penford was awaiting her with unconcealed
impatience. Upon the white scrubbed table stood the preparations
for the making of pastry, an art which Stella, who had
insisted upon making herself useful, had coaxed Mrs. Penfold
into teaching her. At first that good woman had insisted that
Stella should do nothing in the little household. She had announced
with terrible gravity that such things weren't becoming
to a young lady like Miss Stella, and that she had always
done for Mr. Etheridge, and she always would; but before the
second day had passed Stella had won the battle. As Mrs. Penfold
said, there was no resisting the girl, who mingled willfulness
with bewitching firmness and persuasion, and Mrs. Penfold
had given in. "You'll cover yourself with flour, Miss Stella,
and give your uncle the indigestion, miss, that you will," she
remonstrated.</p>

<p>"But the flour will brush off, and uncle needn't eat pies and
puddings for a little while; I'll eat them, I don't mind indigestion,"
Stella declared, and she made a delightfully piquant little
apron, which completed Mrs. Penfold's conquest.</p>

<p>With a song upon her lips she burst into the kitchen and
caught up the rolling pin.</p>

<p>"Am I not awfully late?" she exclaimed. "I was afraid you
would have done it all before I came, but you wouldn't be so
mean as to take an advantage, would you?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Penfold grunted.</p>

<p>"It's all nonsense, Miss Stella, there's no occasion for it."</p>

<p>Stella, with her hand in the flour, elevated the rolling-pin in
heroic style.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Penfold!" she exclaimed, with the air of a princess,
"the woman, be her station what it may, who cannot make a
jam roley-poley or an apple tart is unworthy the name of an
Englishwoman. Give me the jam; stop though, don't you
think rhubarb would be very nice for a change?"</p>

<p>"I wish you'd go and play the organ, Miss Stella, and leave
the rhubarb alone."</p>

<p>"Man cannot live on music," retorted Stella; "his soul craves
for puddings. I wonder whether uncle's soul craves for jam or
rhubarb. I think I'll go and ask him," and dropping the rolling-pin&mdash;which
Mrs. Penfold succeeded in catching before it fell on
the floor&mdash;she wiped her hand of a fifteenth part of the floor and
ran into the studio.</p>

<p>"Uncle! I have come to lay before you the rival claims of
rhubarb and strawberry jam. The one is sweet and luscious to
the taste, but somewhat cloying; the other is fresh and young,
but somewhat sour&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good Heavens! What are you talking about?" exclaimed
the bewildered painter, staring at her.</p>

<p>"Rhubarb or jam. Now, noble Roman, speak or die!" she
exclaimed with upraised arm, her eyes dancing, her lips apart
with rippling laughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Etheridge stared at her with all an artist's admiration in
his eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh! the pudding," he said, then he suddenly stopped, and
stared beyond her.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Stella</span> heard a step on the threshold of the window, and
turning to follow the direction of his eyes, saw the stalwart form
of Lord Leycester standing in the window.</p>

<p>He was dressed in a suit of brown velveteen, with tight-fitting
breeches and stockings, and carried a whip in his hand with
which he barred the entrance against a couple of colleys, a huge
mastiff, and a Skye terrier, the last barking with furious indignation
at being kept outside.</p>

<p>Even at the moment of surprise, Stella was conscious of a
sudden reluctant thrill of admiration for the graceful figure in
the close-fitting velvet, and the handsome face with its dark
eyes regarding her with a grave, respectful intenseness.</p>

<p>"Back dogs!" he said. "Go back, Vix!" then as they drew
back, the big ones throwing themselves down on the path with
patient obedience, he came into the room.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," he said, standing before Stella, his head
bent. "I thought Mr. Etheridge was alone, or I should not have
entered in this rough fashion."</p>

<p>As he spoke in the lane, so now it was no meaningless excuse,
but with a tone of most reverential respect and proud humility,
Stella, girl-like, noticed that he did not even venture to hold out
his hand, and certainly Mr. Adelstone's self-satisfied smile and
assured manner rose in her mind to contrast with this stately,
high-bred humility.</p>

<p>"Do not apologize; it does not matter," she said, conscious
that her face had grown crimson and that her eyes were downcast.</p>

<p>"Does it not? I am forgiven," and he held out his hand.</p>

<p>Stella had crossed her hands behind her as he entered with an
instinctive desire to hide her bare arms and the flour, now she
put out her hand a few inches and held it up with a smile.</p>

<p>"I can't," she said.</p>

<p>He looked at the white hand&mdash;at the white arm so beautifully
molded that a sculptor would have sighed over it in despair at
his inability to imitate it, and he still held out his hand.</p>

<p>"I do not mind the flour," he said, not as Mr. Adelstone
would have said it, but simply, naturally.</p>

<p>Stella gave him one small taper finger and he took it and held
it for a moment, his eyes smiling into hers; then he relinquished
it, with not a word of commonplace compliment, but in
silence, and turned to Mr. Etheridge.</p>

<p>"It is quite hopeless to ask you to forgive me for interrupting
you I know, so I won't ask," he said, and there was in his voice,
Stella noticed, a frank candor that was almost boyish but full of
respect. At once it seemed to intimate that he had known and
honored the old man since he, Leycester, was a boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>"How are you, my lord?" said Mr. Etheridge, giving him his
long, thin hand, but still keeping a hold, as it were, on his beloved
easel. "Taking the dogs for a walk? Are they safe?
Take care, Stella!"</p>

<p>For Stella was kneeling down in the midst of them, making
friends with the huge mastiff, much to the jealous disgust of the
others, who were literally crowding and pushing round her.</p>

<p>Lord Leycester looked round and was silent for a moment;
his eyes fixed on the kneeling girl rather than on the dogs.
Then he said, suddenly:</p>

<p>"They are quite safe," and then he added, for Stella's behalf,
"they are quite safe, Miss Etheridge."</p>

<p>Stella turned her face toward him.</p>

<p>"I am not afraid. I should as soon think of biting them as
they would dream of biting me, wouldn't you?" and she drew
the mastiffs great head on to her lap, where it lay with his big
eyes looking up at her piteously, as he licked her hand.</p>

<p>"Great Heavens, what a herd of them!" said Mr. Etheridge,
who loved dogs&mdash;on canvas.</p>

<p>"I ought not to have brought them," said Lord Leycester,
"but they will be quite quiet, and will do no harm, I assure
you."</p>

<p>"I don't care if they don't bite my niece," said Mr. Etheridge.</p>

<p>"There is no fear of that," he said, quietly, "or I should not
allow her to go near them. Please go on with your work, or I
shall think I am a nuisance."</p>

<p>Mr. Etheridge waved him to a chair.</p>

<p>"Won't you sit down?" he said.</p>

<p>Lord Leycester shook his head.</p>

<p>"I have come to ask you a favor," he said.</p>

<p>Mr. Etheridge nodded.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>Lord Leycester laughed his rare laugh.</p>

<p>"I am trembling in my shoes," he said. "My tongue cleaves
to my mouth with nervousness&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The old painter glanced round at him, and his face relaxed
into a smile as his eyes rested on the bold, handsome face and
easy grace of the speaker.</p>

<p>"Yes, you look excessively frightened," he said. "What
is it?"</p>

<p>It was noticeable that, excepting in his first greeting, the old
man had not given him the benefit of his title; he had known
him when Leycester had been a boy, running in and out of the
cottage, always followed by a pack of dogs, and generally doing
some mischief.</p>

<p>"I want you to do a little scene for me."</p>

<p>The old man groaned and looked at his picture firmly.</p>

<p>"You know the glade in the woods opening out opposite the
small island. I want you to paint it."</p>

<p>"I am sorry," began the old man.</p>

<p>Lord Leycester went on, interrupting him gently:</p>

<p>"Have you seen it lately?" he said, and as he spoke Stella
came into the room enticing the mastiff after her, with a handful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
of biscuits she had taken from the cheffonier. "It is very
beautiful. It is the loveliest bit on the whole river. Right up
from the stream it stretches green, with the young Spring
leaves, to the sky above the hill. In the open space between the
trees the primroses have made a golden carpet. I saw two kingfishers
sailing up it as I stood and looked this morning, and as I
looked I thought how well, how delightfully you would put it on
canvas. Think! The bright green, the golden foreground, the
early Summer sky to crown the whole, and reflected in the river
running below."</p>

<p>Mr. Etheridge paused in his work and listened, and Stella,
kneeling over the dog, listened too, with down-bent face, and
wondered how the painter could stand so firm and obstinate.</p>

<p>To her the voice sounded like the sweetest music set to some
poem. She saw the picture as he drew it, and in her heart the
music of the words and voice found an echoing harmony.</p>

<p>Forgotten was the other man's warning; vain it would have
been if he had repeated it at that moment. As well associate
the darkness of a Winter's night with the bright gladness of a
Summer's morning, as think of evil in connection with that
noble face and musical voice.</p>

<p>Mr. Etheridge paused, but he shook his head.</p>

<p>"Very fine, very temptingly put; you are a master of words,
Leycester; but I am immovable as a rock. Indeed your eloquence
is wasted; it is not an impressionable man whom you
address. I, James Etheridge, am on this picture. I am lost in
my work, Lord Leycester."</p>

<p>"You will not do it?"</p>

<p>The old man smiled.</p>

<p>"I will not. To another man I should present an excuse, and
mask my refusal. With you anything but a simple 'no' is of
no avail."</p>

<p>Lord Leycester smiled and turned away.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," he said. "I meant it for a present to my sister
Lilian."</p>

<p>Again Stella's eyes turned toward him. This man&mdash;infamous!</p>

<p>The old man put down his brush and turned upon him.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you say so at first?" he said.</p>

<p>Lord Leycester smiled.</p>

<p>"I wanted to see if you would do something for me&mdash;for myself,"
he said, with infinite <i>naivete</i>.</p>

<p>"You want it for Lady Lilian," said Mr. Etheridge. "I will
do it, of course."</p>

<p>"I shan't say thank you," said Lord Leycester. "I have
nothing to thank you for. She shall do that. When will you
come&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Next week&mdash;next month&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now at once," said Lord Leycester, stretching out his hand
with a peculiar gesture which struck Stella by its infinite grace.</p>

<p>The old man groaned.</p>

<p>"I thought so! I thought so! It would always be now at
once with you."</p>

<p>"The Spring won't wait for you! The green of those leaves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
is changing now, very slowly, but surely, as we speak; in a week
it will be gone, and with it half&mdash;all the beauty will go too. You
will come now, will you not?"</p>

<p>Mr. Etheridge looked round with comical dismay, then he
laughed.</p>

<p>Lord Leycester's laugh chimed in, and he turned to Stella
with the air of a man who has conquered and needs no more
words.</p>

<p>"You see," said Mr. Etheridge, "that is the way I am led, like
a pig to market, will I or will I not! And the sketch will take
me, how long?"</p>

<p>"A few hours!"</p>

<p>"And there will be all the things to drag down&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lord Leicester strode to an old-fashioned cabinet.</p>

<p>"I will carry them, and yourself into the bargain if you
like."</p>

<p>Then, with his hand upon the cabinet, he stopped short and
turned to Stella.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon!&mdash;I am always sinning. I forgot that
there was now a presiding spirit. I am so used to taking liberties
with your uncle's belongings; I know where all his paraphernalia
is so well, that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Stella rose and smiled at them.</p>

<p>"Your knowledge is deeper than my uncle's, then," she said.
"Do not beg pardon of me."</p>

<p>"May I?" he said, and he opened the cabinet and took out the
sketching-pad and color-box; then, with some difficulty, he disentangled
a folding camp-stool from a mass of artistic litter in a
corner, and then prepared to depart.</p>

<p>Mr. Etheridge watched these proceedings with a rueful countenance,
but seeing that resistance had long passed out of his
power, he said:</p>

<p>"Where is my hat, Stella? I must go, I suppose."</p>

<p>Lord Leycester opened the door for her, and she went out, followed
by all the dogs, and fetched the soft felt hat, holding it by
the very tips of her fingers.</p>

<p>With a sigh, Mr. Etheridge dropped it on his head.</p>

<p>"Give me some of the things," he said; but Lord Leycester
declined.</p>

<p>"Not one," he said, laughing. And Mr. Etheridge, without
another word, walked out.</p>

<p>Lord Leycester stood looking at Stella, a wistful eagerness in
his eyes.</p>

<p>"I have gone so far," he said, "that I am emboldened to
venture still further. Will you come too?"</p>

<p>Stella started, and an eager light flashed for a moment in her
eyes; then she held out her hands and laughed.</p>

<p>"I have to make a pudding," she said.</p>

<p>He looked at the white arms, and then at her, with an intensified
eagerness.</p>

<p>"If you knew how beautiful the morning is&mdash;how grand the
river looks&mdash;you would let the pudding go."</p>

<p>Stella shook her head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>He inclined his head, too highly bred to persist.</p>

<p>"I am so sorry," he said, simply. "I am sorry now that I
have gained my way. I thought that you would have come."</p>

<p>Stella stood silent, and, with something like a sigh, put down
the things and held out her hand; but as he took the finger
which she gave him, his face brightened, and a light came into
his eyes.</p>

<p>"Are you still firm?"</p>

<p>"I would not desert the pudding for anything, my lord," said
Stella, naively.</p>

<p>At the "my lord," a slight shade covered his face, but it went
again instantly, as he said:</p>

<p>"Well, then, will you come when the inevitable pudding is
made? There," he said, eagerly, and still holding her hand he
drew her to the window and pointed with his whip, "there's the
place! It is not far&mdash;just across the meadows, and through the
first gate. Do you see it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Stella, gently withdrawing her hand.</p>

<p>"And you will come?" he asked, his eyes fixed on hers with
their intent earnestness.</p>

<p>At that instant the word&mdash;the odious word&mdash;"infamous" rang
in her ears, and her face paled. He noticed the sudden pallor,
and his eyes grew dark with earnest questioning.</p>

<p>"I see," he said, quietly, "you will not come!"</p>

<p>What was it that moved her? With a sudden impulse she
raised her eyes and looked at him steadily.</p>

<p>"Yes, I will come!" she said.</p>

<p>He inclined his head without a word, called to the dogs, and
passed out.</p>

<p>Stella stood for a moment looking after them; then she went
into the kitchen&mdash;not laughing nor singing, but with a strange
gravity; a strange feeling had got possession of her.</p>

<p>She felt as if she was laboring under some spell. "Charmed"
is an often misused word, but it is the right word to describe the
sensation. Was it his face or his voice that haunted her? As
she stood absently looking down at the table, simple words, short
and commonplace, which he had used rang in her ears with a
new meaning.</p>

<p>Mrs. Penfold stood and regarded her in curious astonishment.
She was getting used to Stella's quickly changing moods, but the
sudden change bewildered her.</p>

<p>"Let me do it, Miss Stella," she pleaded, but Stella shook her
head firmly; not by one inch would she swerve from her cause
for all the beautiful voice and noble face.</p>

<p>In rapt silence she finished her work, then she went up-stairs
and put on her hat and came down. As she passed out of
the house and down the path, the mastiff leaped the gate and
bounded toward her, and the next moment she saw Lord Leycester
seated on a stile.</p>

<p>He dropped down and came toward her.</p>

<p>"How quick you have been," he said, "I thought a pudding
was a mystery which demanded an immensity of time."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>Stella looked up at him, her dark brows drawn to a straight
line.</p>

<p>"You waited for me?" she said.</p>

<p>"No," he said, simply, "I came back. I did not like to think
that you should come alone."</p>

<p>Stella was silent.</p>

<p>"Are you angry?" he asked, in a low voice.</p>

<p>Stella was silent for a moment, then she looked at him frankly.</p>

<p>"No," she said.</p>

<p>If she had but said "yes," and turned back! But the path,
all beautiful with the bright coloring of Spring stretched before
her, and she had no thought of turning back, no thought or
suspicion of the dark and perilous land toward which she was
traveling by his side.</p>

<p>Already the glamour of love was falling upon her like the soft
mist of a Summer evening; blindly, passively she was moving
toward the fate which the gods had prepared for her.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Side</span> by side they walked across the meadows; the larks rising
before them and soaring up to the heavens with a burst of song;
the river running in silvery silence to the sea; the green trees
waving gently in the Summer breeze; and above them the long
stretching gray masonry of Wyndward Hall.</p>

<p>Lord Leycester was strangely silent for some minutes since
that "Are you angry?" and Stella, as she walked by his side,
stooping now and again to gather a cowslip, glanced up at his
face and wondered whether her uncle could be mistaken, whether
they were not all deceived in thinking the quiet, graceful creature
with the beautiful face and dreamy, almost womanly, soft
eyes, wild and reckless, and desperate and altogether bad. She
almost forgot how she had seen him on that first night of their
meeting, with his whip upraised and the sudden fire of anger in
his eyes.</p>

<p>Presently he spoke, so suddenly that Stella, who had been lost
in her speculations respecting him, started guiltily:</p>

<p>"I have been wondering," he said, "how Mr. Etheridge takes
the change which your presence must make in the cottage."</p>

<p>Stella looked up with surprise, then she smiled.</p>

<p>"He bears it with admirable resignation," she said, with that
air of meek archness which her uncle found so amusing.</p>

<p>Lord Leycester looked down at her.</p>

<p>"That is a rebuke for the presumption of my remark?" he
said.</p>

<p>"No," said Stella.</p>

<p>"I did not mean to be presumptuous. Think. Your uncle has
lived the whole of his life alone, the life of a solitary, a hermit;
suddenly there enters into that life a young and beau&mdash;a young
girl, full of the spirit of youth and its aspirations. It must make
a great change."</p>

<p>"As I said," says Stella, "he bears it with pious fortitude."
Then she added, in a lower voice, "He is very good to me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>"He could not be otherwise," was the quiet response. "I
mean that he could not be anything but good, gentle, and loving
with any living thing. I have known him since I was a boy," he
added. "He was always the same, always living a life of dreams.
I wonder whether he takes you as a dream?"</p>

<p>"A very substantial and responsible one, then," said Stella,
with her little laugh. "One that lasts through the daytime."</p>

<p>He looked at her with that strange intent look which she had
learned that she could not meet.</p>

<p>"And you?" he said.</p>

<p>"I?" said Stella, though she knew what he meant.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"How do you like the change?&mdash;this still, quiet life in the
Thames valley. Are you tired of it already? Will you pine for
all the gayeties you have left?"</p>

<p>Stella looked up at him&mdash;his eyes were still fixed on hers.</p>

<p>"I have left no gayeties," she said. "I left a bare and horrid
school that was as unlike home as the desert of Sahara is like
this lovely meadow. How do I feel? As if I had been translated
to Paradise&mdash;as if I, who was beginning to think that I was alone
in the world I had no business to be in, had found some one
friend to love&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She paused, and he, glancing at the black waistband to her
white dress, said, with the tenderest, most humble voice:</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon. Will you forgive me?&mdash;I did not
know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And his voice broke.</p>

<p>Stella looked up at him with a smile shining through the
unshed tears.</p>

<p>"How&mdash;why should you know? Yes, I was quite alone in
the world. My father died a year ago."</p>

<p>"Forgive me," he murmured; and he laid his hand with a
feather's weight on her arm. "I implore you to forgive me.
It was cruel and thoughtless."</p>

<p>"No," said Stella. "How should you know?"</p>

<p>"If I had been anything better than an unthinking brute, I
might have guessed."</p>

<p>There was a moment's pause, then Stella spoke.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is Paradise. I had no idea England was like this,
they called it the land of fogs."</p>

<p>"You have not seen London on a November evening," he said,
with a laugh. "Most foreigners come over to England and put
up at some hotel at the west-end, and judge the whole land by
the London sample&mdash;very few come even so far as this. You
have not been to London?"</p>

<p>"I passed through it," said Stella, "that is all. But I heard
a great deal about it last night," she added, with a smile.</p>

<p>"Yes!" he said, with great interest&mdash;"last night?"</p>

<p>"Yes, at Mrs. Hamilton's. She was kind enough to ask me
to an evening party, and one of the guests took great pains
to impress me with the importance and magnificence of London."</p>

<p>He looked at her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>"May I ask who she was?" he said.</p>

<p>"It was not a she, but a gentleman. It was Mr. Adelstone."</p>

<p>Lord Leycester thought a moment.</p>

<p>"Adelstone. Adelstone. I don't know him."</p>

<p>Before she was quite aware of it the retort slipped from her
lips.</p>

<p>"He knows you."</p>

<p>He looked at her with a thoughtful smile.</p>

<p>"Does he? I don't remember him. Stay, yes, isn't he a relation
of Mr. Fielding's?"</p>

<p>"His nephew," said Stella, and feeling the dark, penetrating
eyes on her she blushed faintly. It annoyed her, and she struggled
to suppress it, but the blush came and he saw it.</p>

<p>"I remember him now," he said; "a tall, thin dark man. A
lawyer, I believe. Yes, I remember him. And he told you
about London?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Stella, and as she remembered the conversation
of a few hours ago, her color deepened. "He is very amusing
and well-informed, and he took pity on my ignorance in the
kindest way. I was very grateful."</p>

<p>There was something in her tone that made him look at her
questioningly.</p>

<p>"I think," he said, "your gratitude is easily earned."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she retorted; "I am the most ungrateful of beings.
Isn't that uncle sitting there?" she added, quickly, to change the
subject.</p>

<p>He looked up.</p>

<p>"Yes, he is hard at work. I did not think I should have won
him. It was my sister's name that worked the magic charm."</p>

<p>"He is fond of your sister," said Stella, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>His eyes were on her in an instant.</p>

<p>"He has spoken of her?" he said.</p>

<p>Stella could have bitten her tongue out for the slip.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. "He&mdash;he told me about her&mdash;I asked him
whose house it was upon the hills."</p>

<p>"Meaning the Hall?" he said, pointing with his whip.</p>

<p>"Yes, and he told me. I knew by the way he spoke of your
sister that he was fond of her. Her name is Lilian, is it not?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "Lilian," and the name left his lips with soft
tenderness. "I think every one who knows her loves her.
This picture is for her."</p>

<p>Stella glanced up at his face; anything less imperious at that
moment it would be impossible to imagine.</p>

<p>"Lady Lilian is fond of pictures?" she said.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said; "she is devoted to art in all its forms. Yes,
that little sketch will give her more pleasure than&mdash;than&mdash;I
scarcely know what to say. What are women most fond of?"</p>

<p>Stella laughed.</p>

<p>"Diamonds, are they not?"</p>

<p>"Are you fond of them?" he said. "I think not."</p>

<p>"Why not?" she retorted. "Why should I not have the
attributes of my sex? Yes, I am fond of diamonds. I am fond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
of everything that is beautiful and costly and rare. I remember
once going to a ball at Florence."</p>

<p>He looked at her.</p>

<p>"Only to see it!" she exclaimed. "I was too young to be
seen, and they took me in a gallery overlooking the great salon;
and I watched the great ladies in their beautiful dresses and
shining gems, and I thought that I would give all the world to
be like one of them; and the thought spoiled my enjoyment. I
remember coming away crying; you see it was so dark and
solitary in the great gallery, and I felt so mean and insignificant."
And she laughed.</p>

<p>He was listening with earnest interest. Every word she said
had a charm for him; he had never met any girl&mdash;any woman&mdash;like
her, so frank and open-minded. Listening to her was like
looking into a crystal lake, in which everything is revealed and
all is bright and pure.</p>

<p>"And are you wiser now?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Not one whit!" she replied. "I should like now, less than
then, to be shut up in a dark gallery and look on at others
enjoying themselves. Isn't that a confession of an envious and
altogether wicked disposition?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he assented, with a strange smile barely escaping from
under his tawny mustache. "I should be right in prophesying
all sorts of bad endings to you."</p>

<p>As he spoke he opened the gate for her, driving the dogs back
with a crack of his whip so that she might pass first&mdash;a small
thing, but characteristic of him.</p>

<p>The painter looked up.</p>

<p>"Keep those dogs off my back, Leycester," he said. "Well,
Stella, have you concocted your poison?"</p>

<p>Stella went and looked over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Yes, uncle," she said.</p>

<p>"You have been long enough to make twenty indigestible
compounds," he said, gazing at the view he was sketching.</p>

<p>Stella bent her head, to hide the blush which rose as she remembered
how slowly they had walked across the meadows.</p>

<p>"How are you getting on?" said Lord Leycester.</p>

<p>The old man grunted.</p>

<p>"Pretty well; better than I shall now you have come to fidget
about."</p>

<p>Lord Leycester laughed.</p>

<p>"A pretty plain hint that our room is desired more than our
company, Miss Etheridge. Can we not vanish into space?"</p>

<p>Stella laughed and sank down on the grass.</p>

<p>"It is uncle's way of begging us to stay," she said.</p>

<p>Lord Leycester laughed, and sending the dogs off, flung himself
down almost at her feet.</p>

<p>"Did I exaggerate?" he said, pointing his whip at the view.</p>

<p>"Not an atom," replied Stella. "It is beautiful&mdash;beautiful,
and that is all that one can find to say."</p>

<p>"I wish you would be content to say it and not insist upon my
painting it," replied Mr. Etheridge.</p>

<p>Lord Leycester sprang to his feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is the last straw. We will not remain to be abused,
Miss Etheridge," he said.</p>

<p>Stella remained immovable. He came and stood over her,
looking down at her with wistful eagerness in silence.</p>

<p>"What lovely woods," she said. "You were right; they are
carpeted with primroses. We have none in our meadow."</p>

<p>"Would you like to go and get some?" he asked.</p>

<p>Stella turned her face up to him.</p>

<p>"Yes, but I don't care to swim across."</p>

<p>He smiled, and went down to the bank, unfastened a boat, and
leaping into it, called to her.</p>

<p>Stella sprang to her feet with the impulsive delight of a girl
at the sight of a boat, when she had expected nothing better
than rushes.</p>

<p>"Is it a boat&mdash;really?" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Come and see," he said.</p>

<p>She went down to the water's edge and looked at it.</p>

<p>"How did it come there?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I pay a fairy to drop a boat from the skies whenever I want
it."</p>

<p>"I see," said Stella, gravely.</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>"How did you think I came across? Did you think I swam?"
and he arranged a cushion.</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>"I forgot that; how stupid of me."</p>

<p>"Will you step in?" he said.</p>

<p>Stella looked back at her uncle, and hesitated a moment.</p>

<p>"He will assure you that I shall not drown you," he said.</p>

<p>"I am not afraid&mdash;do you think I am afraid?" she said, scornfully.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think that at this moment you are trembling with
nervousness and dread."</p>

<p>She put her foot&mdash;he could not help seeing how small and
shapely it was&mdash;on the gunwale, and he held out his hand and
took hers; it was well he did so, for the boat was only a small,
lightly built gig, and her sudden movement had made it rock.</p>

<p>As it was, she staggered slightly, and he had to take her by
the arm. So, with one hand grasping her hand and the other
her arm, he held her for a moment&mdash;for longer than a moment.
Then he placed her on the cushion, and seating himself, took up
the sculls and pushed off.</p>

<p>Stella leant back, and of course dropped one hand in the
water. Not one woman out of twenty who ever sat in a boat
can resist that impulse to have closer communion with the
water; and he pulled slowly across the stream.</p>

<p>The sun shone full upon them, making their way a path of
rippling gold, and turning Stella's hair into a rich brown.</p>

<p>Little wonder that, as he sat opposite her, his eyes should rest
on her face, and less that, thus resting, its exquisite beauty and
freshness and purity should sink into the soul of him to whom
beauty was the one thing worth living for.</p>

<p>Unconscious of his rapt gaze, Stella leant back, her eyes fixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
on the water, her whole attention absorbed by its musical ripple
as it ran through her fingers.</p>

<p>In silence he pulled the sculls, slowly and noiselessly; he
would not have spoken and broken the spell for worlds. Before
him, as he looked upon her, rose the picture of which he had
spoken to his sister last night.</p>

<p>"But more beautiful," he mused&mdash;"more beautiful! How
lost she is! She has forgotten me&mdash;forgotten everything. Oh,
Heaven! if one were to waken her into love!"</p>

<p>For an instant, at the thought, the color came into his face
and the fire to his eyes; then a half guilty, half repentful feeling
struck through him.</p>

<p>"No, it would be cruel&mdash;cruel: and yet to see the azure light
shining in those eyes&mdash;to see those lips half parted with the
breath of a great passion, would be worth&mdash;what? It would
make amends for all that a man might suffer, though he died
the next moment, if those eyes smiled, if those lips were upturned,
for love of him!"</p>

<p>So lost were they that the touching of the boat and the bank
made them start.</p>

<p>"So soon," murmured Stella. "How beautiful it is! I think
I was dreaming."</p>

<p>"And I know that I was," he said, with a subtle significance,
as he rose and held out his hand. But Stella sprang lightly on
shore without accepting it. He tied up the boat and followed
her; she was already on her knee, picking the yellow primroses.</p>

<p>Without a word, he followed her example. Sometimes they
were so near together that she could feel his breath stirring her
hair&mdash;so near that their hands almost met.</p>

<p>At last she sank on to the mossy ground with a laugh, and,
pointing to her hat, which was full of the spring earth-stars, said
laughingly:</p>

<p>"What ruthless pillage! Do not pick any more; it is wanton
waste!"</p>

<p>"Are you sure you have plenty?" he said. "Why hesitate
when there are such millions?"</p>

<p>"No, no more!" she said. "I feel guilty already!"</p>

<p>He glanced at the handful he had gathered, and she saw the
glance and laughed.</p>

<p>"You do not know what to do with those you have, and still
want more. See, you must tie them in bundles.</p>

<p>"Show me," he said, and he threw himself down beside her.</p>

<p>She gathered them up into bundles, and tied them with a long
stem of fern, and he tried to do the same, but his hands, white
and slender as they were, were not so deft as hers, and he held
the huge bundle to her.</p>

<p>"You must tie it," he said.</p>

<p>She laughed and put the fern round, but it broke, and the primroses
fell in a golden shower over their hands. They both made
a grasp at them, and their hands met.</p>

<p>For a moment Stella laughed, then the laugh died away, for
he still held her hand, and the warmth of his grasp seemed stealing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
upward to her heart. With something like an effort she
drew her hand away, and sprang to her feet.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I must go," she said. "Uncle will wonder where I have
gone," and she looked down at the water with almost frightened
eagerness.</p>

<p>"He will know you are here, quite safe," he said. "Wait, do
not go this moment. Up there, above our heads, we can see the
river stretching away for miles. It is not a step; will you
come?"</p>

<p>She hesitated a moment, then she turned and walked beside
him between the trees.</p>

<p>A step or two, as he said, and they reached a sort of plateau,
crowned by a moss-grown rock, in which some rough steps were
hewn. He sprang up the steps and reached the top, then bent
down and held out his hand.</p>

<p>Stella hesitated a moment.</p>

<p>"It will repay your trouble; come," he said, and she put her
hand in his and her foot on the first step, and he drew her up
beside him.</p>

<p>"Look!" he said.</p>

<p>An exclamation of delight broke from Stella's lips.</p>

<p>"You are not sorry you came?"</p>

<p>"I did not think it would be so lovely," she said.</p>

<p>He stood beside her, not looking at the view, but at her dark
eyes dilating with dreamy rapture&mdash;at her half-parted lips, and
the sweet, clear-cut profile presented to him.</p>

<p>She turned suddenly, and to hide the look of admiration he
raised his hand and pointed out the objects in the view.</p>

<p>"And what is that little house there?" asked Stella.</p>

<p>"That is one of the lodges," he said.</p>

<p>"One of the lodges&mdash;one of your own lodges, you mean?" she
asked.</p>

<p>He nodded lightly, "Yes."</p>

<p>"And all this between here and that lodge belongs to you?"</p>

<p>"No, not an inch," he said, laughing. "To my father."</p>

<p>"It is a great deal," she said.</p>

<p>"Too much for one man, you think?" he said, with a smile.
"A great many other people think so too. I don't know what
you would think if you knew how much we Wyndwards have
managed at one time or the other to lay our acquiring grasp on.
This is one of our smallest estates," he said, simply.</p>

<p>Stella looked at the view dreamily.</p>

<p>"One of the smallest? Yes, I have heard that you are very
rich. It must be very nice."</p>

<p>"I don't know," he said. "You see one cannot tell until one
has been poor. I don't think there is anything in it. I don't think
one is any the happier. There is always something left to long
for."</p>

<p>She turned her dark eyes on him with a smile of incredulity.</p>

<p>"What can you possibly have to long for?" she said.</p>

<p>He looked at her with a strange smile; then suddenly his face
grew grave and wistful&mdash;almost sad, as it seemed to her.</p>

<p>"You cannot guess, and I cannot tell you; but believe me that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
as I stand here, there is an aching void in my heart, and I do
long for something very earnestly."</p>

<p>The voice was like music, deep and thrilling; she listened and
wondered.</p>

<p>"And you should be so happy," she said, almost unconsciously.</p>

<p>"Happy!" he echoed, and his dark eyes rested on hers with a
strange expression that was half-mocking, half-sad. "Do you
know what the poets say?"</p>

<p>"'Count no man happy till he dies,' do you mean?" said
Stella.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "I do not think I know what happiness means.
I have been pursuing it all my life; sometimes have been within
reach of it but it has always evaded me&mdash;always slipped from
my grasp. Sometimes I have resolved to let it go&mdash;to pursue it
no longer; but fate has decreed that man shall always be seeking
for the unattainable&mdash;that he who once looks upon
happiness with the eyes of desire, who stretches out his hands
toward her, shall pursue her to the end."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;but surely some get their desire."</p>

<p>"Some," he said, "to find that the prize is not worth the race
they have run for it; to find that they have wearied of it when
it is gained; to find that it is no prize at all, but a delusive blank;
all dead sea fruit that turns to dust upon the lips."</p>

<p>"Not all; surely not all!" she murmured, strangely moved
by his words.</p>

<p>"No; not all," he said, with a hidden light in his eyes that
she did not see. "To some there comes a moment when they
know that happiness&mdash;real true happiness&mdash;lies just beyond their
grasp. And the case of rich men is more to be pitied than all
others. What would you say if I told you that it was mine?"</p>

<p>She looked up at him with a gentle smile, not on her lips but
in her eyes.</p>

<p>"I should say that I was very sorry," she murmured. "I
should say that you deserved&mdash;&mdash;" she stopped short, smitten by
sudden remembrance of all she had heard of him.</p>

<p>He filled up the pause with a laugh: a laugh such as she had
not heard upon his lips till now.</p>

<p>"You were right to stop," he said. "If I get all the happiness
I deserve&mdash;well, no man will envy me."</p>

<p>"Let us go down now," said Stella, gently; "my uncle&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He leapt down, and held up his hand.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Stella</span> put hers into it, but reluctantly, and tried to spring,
but her dress caught and she slipped forward.</p>

<p>She would have fallen but that he was on the alert to save
her. Quite simply and naturally he put his arms round her and
lifted her down.</p>

<p>Only for a moment he held her in his embrace, her panting
form close to his, her face almost resting on his shoulders, but
that moment roused the blood in his fiery heart, and her face
went pale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you hurt?" he murmured.</p>

<p>"No, no!" she said, and she slipped out of his arms and stood
a little away from him, the color coming and going in her face;
it was the first time that any man's arms, save her father's, had
ever encircled her.</p>

<p>"Are you quite sure?" he repeated.</p>

<p>"Quite," she said, then she laughed. "What would have
happened if I had slipped?"</p>

<p>"You would have sprained your ankle," he said.</p>

<p>"Sprained my ankle, really?" she repeated, with open eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes, and I should have had to carry you down to the boat,"
he said, slowly.</p>

<p>She looked away from him.</p>

<p>"I am glad I did not slip."</p>

<p>"And I," he said, "am&mdash;glad also."</p>

<p>She stooped and picked up the primroses and ran down the
slope, her cheeks aflame, a feeling that was something like
shame, and yet too full of a strange, indefinable joy to be sullen
shame, took possession of her.</p>

<p>With light feet, her hat swinging in her hand, she threaded
her way between the trees and sprang on to the grassy road beside
the river bank.</p>

<p>He did not follow so quickly, but stood for a moment looking
at her, his face pale, his eyes full of a strange, wistful restlessness.</p>

<p>Then Stella heard his step, firm and masterful, behind her.
A sudden impulse tempted her sorely to jump into the boat and
push off&mdash;she could pull a pair of sculls&mdash;and her hand was
on the edge of the boat, when she heard the sound of bells, and
paused with astonishment. Looking up she saw a tiny phæton
drawn by a pair of cream-white ponies coming along the road;
it was the bells on their harness that she had heard.</p>

<p>They came along at a fair pace, and Stella saw that the
phæton was being driven by a coachman in dark-brown
livery, but the next moment all her attention was absorbed
by the young girl who sat beside him.</p>

<p>She was so fair, so lovely, so ethereal looking, that Stella was
spellbound.</p>

<p>A book was in her hand&mdash;ungloved and small and white as a
child's&mdash;but she was not reading. She held it so loosely that as
the phæton came along the top of the bank which hid Stella,
the book dropped from the lax grasp of the white fingers.</p>

<p>The girl uttered an exclamation, and Stella, obeying one of her
sudden impulses, sprang lightly up the bank, and picking up
the book, held it toward her.</p>

<p>Her appearance was so sudden that Lady Lilian was startled
and for a moment the pale face was dyed with a faint color;
even after the moment had passed she sat speechless, and the
surprise in her eyes gave place to a frank, generous admiration.</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you&mdash;thank you!" she said. "How kind of you.
It was so stupid of me to drop it. But where did you come from&mdash;the
clouds?" And there was a delicious hint of flattery in the
look that accompanied the words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>"Quite the reverse," said Stella, with her open smile. "I
was standing below there, by the boat."</p>

<p>And she pointed.</p>

<p>"Oh?" said Lady Lilian. "I did not see you."</p>

<p>"You were looking the other way," said Stella, drawing back
to allow the carriage to proceed; but Lady Lilian seemed reluctant
to go, and made no sign to the coachman, who sat holding
the reins like an image of stone, apparently deaf and dumb.</p>

<p>For a few strokes of Time's scythe the two girls looked at
each other&mdash;the one with the pale face and the blue eyes regarding
the fresh, healthful beauty of the other with sad, wistful
gaze. Then Lady Lilian spoke.</p>

<p>"What beautiful primroses! You have been gathering them
on the slopes?" with a suggestion of a sigh.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Stella. "Will you take them?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no; I could not think of robbing you."</p>

<p>Stella smiled with her characteristic archness.</p>

<p>"It is I who have been the thief. I have been taking what
did not belong to me. You will take these?"</p>

<p>Lady Lilian was too well bred to refuse; besides, she thirsted
for them.</p>

<p>"If you will give them to me, and will not mind picking
some more," she said.</p>

<p>Stella laid the bunch on the costly sables which wrapped the
frail figure.</p>

<p>Lady Lilian put them to her face with a caressing gesture.
"You are, like me, fond of flowers?" she said.</p>

<p>Stella nodded. "Yes."</p>

<p>Then there was a pause. Above them, unseen by Lilian, forgotten
by Stella, stood Lord Leycester.</p>

<p>He was watching and waiting with a strange smile. He could
read the meaning in his sister's eyes; she was longing to know
more of the beautiful girl who had sprang like a fairy to her side.</p>

<p>With a faint flush, Lady Lilian said:</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you are a stranger, are you not? I mean you do not
live here?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Stella; "I live"&mdash;and she smiled and pointed to
the cottage across the meadow&mdash;"there."</p>

<p>Lady Lilian started, and Lord Leycester seized the moment,
and coming down, quietly stood by Stella's side.</p>

<p>"Leycester!" exclaimed Lilian, with a start of surprise.</p>

<p>He smiled into her eyes, his strange, masterful, irresistible
smile. It was as if he had said, "Did I not tell you? Can you
withstand her?"</p>

<p>But aloud he said:</p>

<p>"Let me make the introduction in due form. This is Miss
Etheridge, Lilian. Miss Etheridge, this is my sister. As the
French philosopher said, 'Know each other.'"</p>

<p>Lady Lilian held out her hand.</p>

<p>"I am very glad," she said.</p>

<p>Stella took the thin, white hand, and held it for a moment;
then Lady Lilian looked from one to the other.</p>

<p>Lord Leycester interpreted the glance at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>"Miss Etheridge has intrusted herself on the watery deep with
me," he said. "We came across to gather flowers, leaving Mr.
Etheridge to paint there."</p>

<p>And he waved his hand across the river.</p>

<p>Lady Lilian looked.</p>

<p>"I see," she said&mdash;"I see. And he is painting. Is he not
clever? How proud you must be of him!"</p>

<p>Stella's eyes grew dark. It was the one word wanting to
draw them together. She said not a word.</p>

<p>"Your uncle and I are old friends," Lady Lilian continued.
"Sometime when&mdash;when I am stronger, I am coming to see him&mdash;when
the weather gets warmer&mdash;" Stella glanced at the frail
form clad in sables, with a moistened eye&mdash;"I am going to spend
a long afternoon among the pictures. He is always so kind and
patient, and explains them all to me. But, as I am not able to
come to you, you will come and see me, will you not?"</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence. Lord Leycester stood looking
over the river as if waiting for Stella's reply.</p>

<p>Stella looked up.</p>

<p>"I shall be very glad," she said, and Lord Leycester drew a
breath, almost of relief.</p>

<p>"You will, will you not?" said Lady Lilian, with a sweet
smile.</p>

<p>"Yes, I will come," said Stella, almost solemnly.</p>

<p>"You will find me poor company," said the daughter of the
great earl, with meek humility. "I see so little of the world
that I grow dull and ignorant; but I shall be so glad to see
you," and she held out her hand.</p>

<p>Stella took it in her warm, soft fingers.</p>

<p>"I will come," she said.</p>

<p>Lady Lilian looked at the coachman, who, though his eyes
were fixed in quite another direction, seemed to see the glance,
for he touched the horses with the whip.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," she said, "good-bye."</p>

<p>Then, as the phæton moved on, she called out, in her low,
musical voice, that was a low echo of her brother's:</p>

<p>"Oh, Leycester, Lenore has come!"</p>

<p>Leycester raised his hat.</p>

<p>"Very well," he said. "Good-bye."</p>

<p>Stella stood a moment looking after her. Strangely enough
the last words rang in her ears with a senseless kind of insistence
and emphasis. "Lenore has come!" She found herself
repeating them mentally.</p>

<p>Recalling herself she turned swiftly to Lord Leycester.</p>

<p>"How beautiful she is!" she said, almost in a whisper.</p>

<p>He looked at her with gratitude in his eloquent eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"So beautiful and so kind!" Stella murmured, and the tears
sprang to her eyes. "I can see her face now. I can hear her
voice. I do not wonder that you love her as you do."</p>

<p>"How do you know that I love her?" he said. "Brothers,
generally&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Stella stopped him with a gesture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"No man with a heart warmer than a stone could help loving
her."</p>

<p>"And so you agree that my heart is warmer than a stone.
Thank you for that, at least," he said, with a smile that was not
at all unselfish.</p>

<p>Stella looked at him.</p>

<p>"Let us go now," she said. "See, uncle is getting his things
together."</p>

<p>"Not without the primroses," he said; "Lilian will break
her heart if you go without any. Let me get some," and he
went up the slope.</p>

<p>Stella stood in thought. The sudden meeting with the fairy-like
creatures, had filled her with strange thoughts. She understood
now that rank and money are not all that is wanted for
earthly happiness.</p>

<p>So lost in thought was she that she did not hear the sound of a
horse coming along the mossy road, though the animal was coming
at a great pace.</p>

<p>Lord Leycester's ears were freer or quicker however, for he
caught the sound and turned round.</p>

<p>Turned round in time to see a huge bay horse ridden by a tall,
thin, dark young man, almost upon the slim form, standing with
its back to it.</p>

<p>With something like an oath on his lips, he dropped the flowers
and with one spring stood between her and the horse, and
seizing the bridle with both hands threw the beast, with sheer
force, on to its haunches.</p>

<p>The rider had been staring at the river, and was taken by surprise
so complete, that, as the horse rose on its legs, he was
thrown from the saddle.</p>

<p>Stella, alarmed by the noise, turned and swerved out of the
path. And so they were grouped. Lord Leycester, pale with
furious passion, still holding the reins and forcing the horse in
an iron grip, and the erstwhile rider lying huddled up on the
mossy road.</p>

<p>He lay still, only for a moment, however; the next he was
on his feet and advancing toward Lord Leycester. It was Jasper
Adelstone.</p>

<p>His face was deadly pale, making, by contrast, his small eyes
black as coals.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he exclaimed, furiously, and half-unconsciously
he raised his whip.</p>

<p>It was an unlucky gesture, for it was all that was needed to
rouse the devil in Lord Leycester's breast.</p>

<p>With one little irresistible gesture he seized the whip arm and
the whip, and flinging the owner to the ground again with one
movement, broke the whip, and flung it on the top of him with
the other.</p>

<p>It was all done in a second. With all the will in the world,
Stella had no time to interpose before the rash act was accomplished;
but now she sprang between them.</p>

<p>"Lord Leycester," she cried, pale and horror-stricken, as she
gazed into his face, white and working with passion; all its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
beauty gone, and with the mask of a fury in its place. "Lord
Leycester!"</p>

<p>At the sound of her voice&mdash;pleading, expostulating, rebuking&mdash;a
shiver ran through him, his hand fell to his side, and still
holding the now plunging and furious horse with a grip of steel,
he stood humbly before her.</p>

<p>Not so Jasper Adelstone. With a slow, sinuous movement he
rose and shook himself, and glared at him. Speechless from the
sheer breathlessness of furious hate he stood and looked at the
tall, velvet-clad figure.</p>

<p>Stella was the first to break the silence.</p>

<p>"Oh, my lord!" she said.</p>

<p>At the sound of her reproachful voice, Lord Leycester's face
paled.</p>

<p>"Forgive me," he said, humbly. "I beg&mdash;I crave your forgiveness;
but I thought you were in danger, you were&mdash;you
were!" Then, at the thought, his fiery passion broke out again,
and he turned to the silent, white-faced Jasper. "What the
devil do you mean by riding in that fashion?"</p>

<p>Jasper Adelstone's lips moved, and at last speech came.</p>

<p>"You shall answer for this, Lord Leycester."</p>

<p>It was the worst word he could have said.</p>

<p>In an instant all Lord Leycester's repentances fled.</p>

<p>With a smothered oath on his lips, he advanced toward him.</p>

<p>"What! Is that all you have to say? Do you know, you
miserable wretch, that you nearly rode over this lady&mdash;yes, rode
over her? Answer for it! Confound you&mdash;&mdash;" and he raised his arm.</p>

<p>But Stella, all her wits on the <i>qui vive</i>, was in time, and her
own arms were wound about his, on which the muscles stood
thick and prominent&mdash;like iron bands.</p>

<p>With a gesture he became calm again, and there was a mute
prayer for pardon in his eyes as he looked at her.</p>

<p>"Do not be afraid," he murmured, between his lips; "I will
not hurt him. No, no."</p>

<p>Then he pointed to the horse.</p>

<p>"Mount, sir, and get out of my sight. Stop!" and the fiery
passion broke out again. "No, by Heaven, you shall not, until
you have begged the lady's pardon."</p>

<p>"No, no!" said Stella.</p>

<p>"But I say 'Yes!'" said Lord Leycester, his eyes blazing. "Is
every tailor to ride through the Chase and knock down whom he
will? Ask for pardon, sir, or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jasper stood looking from one to the other.</p>

<p>"No, no!" said Stella. "It was all an accident. Please, pray
do not say another word. Mr. Adelstone, I beg you will go without
another word."</p>

<p>Jasper Adelstone hesitated for a moment.</p>

<p>"Miss Stella," he said, hoarsely.</p>

<p>Alas! it was oil on the smoldering fire.</p>

<p>"Miss Stella!" exclaimed Lord Leycester. "Who gave you
the right to address this lady by her Christian name, sir?"</p>

<p>Jasper bit his lip.</p>

<p>"Miss Etheridge, you cannot doubt that I am heartily sorry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
that this unpleasant contretemps should have been caused by
my carelessness. I was riding carelessly&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Like an idiot!" broke in Lord Leycester.</p>

<p>"And did not see you. No harm would have resulted, however,
if this man&mdash;if Lord Leycester Wyndward had not, with
brutal force, thrown me from the saddle. I should have seen
you in time, and, as I say, no harm would have been done. All
that has occurred is this man&mdash;Lord Leycester Wyndward's&mdash;fault.
Again I beg your pardon."</p>

<p>And he bent his head before her. But as he did so a malignant
gleam shot out of his eyes in the direction of the tall, stalwart
figure and white, passionate face.</p>

<p>"No, no, there is no occasion!" said Stella, trembling. "I do
not want you to beg my pardon. It was only an accident. You
did not expect to see anyone here&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;oh, I wish I had not
come."</p>

<p>Lord Leycester started.</p>

<p>"Do not say that," he murmured.</p>

<p>Then aloud:</p>

<p>"Here is your horse, sir; mount him and go home, and thank
your stars the lady has escaped without a broken limb."</p>

<p>Jasper stood a moment looking at him, then, with another inclination
of the head, he slowly mounted the horse.</p>

<p>Lord Leycester, his passion gone, stood calm and motionless
for a moment, then raised his hat with an old-world gesture.</p>

<p>"Good-day to you, and remember to ride more carefully in
future."</p>

<p>Jasper Adelstone looked down at him with a malignant smile
on his thin lips.</p>

<p>"Good-day, my lord. I shall remember. I am not one to
forget. No, I am not one to forget," and striking spurs into the
horse, he rode off.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">"Who</span> is 'Lenore,' uncle?"</p>

<p>It was the evening of the same day&mdash;a day never to be forgotten
by Stella, a day marked with a white stone in her mental
calendar. Never would she be able to look upon a field of primroses,
never hear the music of the river running over the weir,
without remembering this morning the first she had spent with
Lord Leycester.</p>

<p>It was evening now, and the two&mdash;the painter and the girl&mdash;were
sitting by the open window, looking out into the gloaming,
he lost in memory, she going over and over again the incidents
of the morning, from the visit of Mr. Jasper Adelstone to his
encounter with Lord Leycester.</p>

<p>It was strange, it was almost phenomenal&mdash;for Stella was
frankness and candor itself&mdash;that she had said nothing of the
encounter to her uncle; once or twice she had opened her lips&mdash;once
at dinner, and once again as she sat beside him, leaning her
arm on his chair while he smoked his pipe&mdash;she had opened her
lips to tell him of that sudden outburst of fury on the part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Lord Leycester&mdash;that passionate rage which proved all that the
painter had said of his hot temper to be true, but she had found
some difficulty in the recital which had kept her silent.</p>

<p>She had told him of her walk in the woods, had told him of
her meeting with Lady Lilian, but of that passionate encounter
between the two men she said nothing.</p>

<p>When Jasper had ridden on, pale and livid with suppressed
passion, Lord Leycester had stood looking at her in silence.
Now, as she sat looking into the gloaming, she saw him in her
mind's eye still, his beautiful eyes eloquent with remorse and
humility, his clear-cut lip quivering with the sense of his weakness.</p>

<p>"Will you forgive me?" he said, at last, and that was all.
Without another word, he had offered to help her into the boat,
help which Stella had disregarded, and had rowed her across to
her uncle. Without a word, but with the same penitent, imploring
look in his eyes, he raised his hat and left her&mdash;had gone
home to the Hall, to his sister Lady Lilian, and to Lenore.</p>

<p>Ever since she had heard the name drop softly from Lady
Lilian's lips it had rung in her ears. There was a subtle kind of
charm about it that half fascinated, half annoyed her.</p>

<p>And now, leaning her head on her arm, and with her dark
eyes fixed on the stars which glittered merrily in the sky, she
put the question:</p>

<p>"Who is Lenore, uncle?"</p>

<p>He stirred in his chair and looked at her absently.</p>

<p>"Lenore, Lenore? I don't know, Stella, and yet the name
sounds familiar. Where did you hear it? It's scarcely fair to
spring a question like that on me; you might ask me who is
Julia, Louisa, Anna Maria&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Stella laughed softly.</p>

<p>"I heard it this morning, uncle. Lady Lilian told her brother
as she left us that 'Lenore had come.'"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," he said. "Now I know. So she has come, has
she? Who is Lenore?" and he smiled. "There is scarcely
another woman in England who would need to ask that question,
Stella."</p>

<p>"No?" she said, turning her eyes upon him with surprise.
"Why? Is she so famous?"</p>

<p>"Exactly, yes; that is just the word. She is famous."</p>

<p>"For what, uncle? Is she a great actress, painter, musician&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"She is something that the world, nowadays, reckons far
above any of the classes you have named, Stella&mdash;she is a great
beauty."</p>

<p>"Oh, is that all!" said Stella, curtly.</p>

<p>"All!" he echoed, amused.</p>

<p>"Yes," and she nodded. "It seems so easy."</p>

<p>"So easy!" and he laughed.</p>

<p>"Yes," she continued; "so very easy, if you happen to be born
so. There is no merit in it. And is that all she is?"</p>

<p>He was staggered by her <i>sang froid</i> for a moment.</p>

<p>"Well, I was scarcely fair, perhaps. As you say, it is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
easy to be a great beauty&mdash;if you are one&mdash;but it is rather difficult
if you are not; but Lenore is something more than that&mdash;she
is an enchantress."</p>

<p>"That's better," remarked Stella. "I like that. And how does
she enchant? Does she keep tame snakes, and play music to
them, or mesmerize people, or what?"</p>

<p>The painter laughed again with great enjoyment at her
<i>naivete</i>.</p>

<p>"You are quite a cynic, Stella. Where did you learn the
trick; from your father, or is it a natural gift? No, she does
not keep tame snakes, and I don't know that she has acquired
the art of mesmerism; but she can charm for all that. First,
she is, really and truly, very beautiful&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tell me what she is like?" interrupted Stella, softly.</p>

<p>The old man paused a moment to light his pipe.</p>

<p>"She is very fair," he said.</p>

<p>"I know," said Stella, dreamily, and with a little smile; "with
yellow hair and blue eyes, and a pink and white complexion,
and blue veins and a tiny mouth."</p>

<p>"All wrong," he said, with, a laugh. "You have, woman-like,
pictured a china doll. Lenore is as unlike a china doll as
it is possible to imagine. She has golden hair it is true&mdash;but
golden hair, not yellow; there is a difference. Then her eyes
are not blue; they are violet."</p>

<p>"Violet!"</p>

<p>"Violet!" he repeated, gravely. "I have seen them as
violet as the flowers that grow on the bank over there. Her
mouth is not small; there was never yet a woman worth a fig
who had a small mouth. It is rather large than otherwise, but
then it is&mdash;a mouth."</p>

<p>"Expressive?" said Stella, quietly.</p>

<p>"Eloquent," he corrected. "The sort of mouth that can speak
volumes with a curve of the lip. You think I exaggerate?
Wait until you see her."</p>

<p>"I don't think," said Stella, slowly, "that I am particularly
desirous of seeing her, uncle. It reminds we of what they say
of Naples&mdash;see Naples and die! See Lenore and die!"</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>"Well, it is not altogether false; many have seen her&mdash;many
men, and been ready to die for love of her."</p>

<p>Stella laughed, softly.</p>

<p>"She must be very beautiful for you to talk like this, uncle.
She is charming too?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she is charming," he said, low; "with a charm that
one is bound to admit at once and unreservedly."</p>

<p>"But what does she do?" asked Stella, with a touch of feminine
impatience.</p>

<p>"What does she not?" he answered. "There is scarcely an
accomplishment under the sun or moon that she has not at her
command. In a word, Stella, Lenore is the outcome of the
higher civilization; she is the type of our latest requirement,
which demands more than mere beauty, and will not be satisfied
with mere cleverness; she rides beautifully and fearlessly; she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
plays and sings better than one-half the women one hears at
concerts; they tell me that no woman in London can dance
with greater grace, and I have seen her land a salmon of twenty
pounds with all the skill of a Scotch gillie."</p>

<p>Stella was silent a moment.</p>

<p>"You have described a paragon, uncle. How all her women
friends must detest her."</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>"I think you are wrong. I never knew a woman more popular
with her sex."</p>

<p>"How proud her husband must be of her," murmured Stella.</p>

<p>"Her husband! What husband? She is not married."</p>

<p>Stella laughed.</p>

<p>"Not married! Such a perfection unmarried! Is it possible
that mankind can permit such a paragon to remain single.
Uncle, they must be afraid of her!"</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps they are&mdash;some of them," he assented, smiling.
"No," he continued, musingly; "she is not married. Lenore
might have been married long before this: she has had many
chances, and some of them great ones. She might have been a
duchess by this time if she had chosen."</p>

<p>"And why did she not?" said Stella. "Such a woman should
be nothing less than a duchess. It is a duchess whom you have
described, uncle."</p>

<p>"I don't know," he said, simply. "I don't think anyone
knows; perhaps she does not know herself."</p>

<p>Stella was silent for a moment; her imagination was hard at
work.</p>

<p>"Is she rich, poor&mdash;what, uncle?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Rich, I should think," he answered.</p>

<p>"And what is her other name, or has she only one name, like
a princess or a church dignitary?"</p>

<p>"Her name is Beauchamp&mdash;Lady Lenore Beauchamp."</p>

<p>"Lady!" repeated Stella, surprised. "She has a title, then;
it was all that was wanted."</p>

<p>"Yes, she is the daughter of a peer."</p>

<p>"What a happy woman she must be;&mdash;is she a woman or a
girl, though. I have imagined her a woman of thirty."</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>"Lady Lenore is&mdash;is"&mdash;he thought a moment&mdash;"just twenty-three."</p>

<p>"That's a woman," said Stella, decidedly. "And this wonderful
creature is at the Hall, within sight of us. Tell me, uncle,
do they keep her in a glass case, and only permit her to be seen
as a curiosity at so much a head? They ought to do so, you
know."</p>

<p>He laughed, and his hand stroked her hair.</p>

<p>"What is it Voltaire says, Stella," he remarked. "'If you
want a woman to hate another, praise her to the first one.'"</p>

<p>Stella's face flushed hotly, and she laughed with just a touch
of scorn.</p>

<p>"Hate! I don't hate her, uncle&mdash;I admire her; I should like
to see her, to touch her&mdash;to feel for myself the wonderful charm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
of which you speak. I should like to see how she bears it; it
must be strange, you know, to be superior to all one's kind."</p>

<p>"If she feels strange," he said, thoughtfully, "she does not
show it. I never saw more perfect grace and ease than hers.
I do not think anything in the world would ruffle her. I think
if she were on board a ship that was going down inch by inch,
and she knew that she was within, say, five minutes of death,
she would not flinch, or drop for a moment the smile which
usually rests upon her lips. That is her charm, Stella&mdash;the perfect
ease and perfect grace which spring from a consciousness
of her power."</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment. The painter had spoken in
his usual dreamy fashion, more like communion with his own
thoughts than a direct address to his hearer, and Stella, listening,
allowed every word to sink into her mind.</p>

<p>His description impressed her strongly, more than she cared
to admit. Already, so it seemed to her, she felt fascinated by
this beautiful creature, who appeared as perfect and faultless as
one of the heathen goddesses&mdash;say Diana.</p>

<p>"Where does she live?" she asked, dreamily.</p>

<p>He smoked in silence for a moment.</p>

<p>"Live? I scarcely know; she is everywhere. In London in
the season, visiting in country houses at other times. There is
not a house in England where she would not be received with a
welcome accorded to princes. It is rather strange that she
should be down here just now; the season has commenced, most
of the visitors have left the Hall, some of them to be in their
places in Parliament. It is rather strange that she should have
come down at this time."</p>

<p>Stella colored, and a feeling of vague irritation took possession
of her&mdash;why, she scarcely knew.</p>

<p>"I should think that everyone would be glad to come to
Wyndward Hall at any time&mdash;even Lady Lenore Beauchamp,"
she said, in a low voice.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"Wyndward Hall is a fine place," he said, slowly, "but Lady
Lenore is accustomed to&mdash;well, to palaces. There is not a ball-room
in London where her absence will not be noticed. It is
strange. Perhaps"&mdash;and he smiled&mdash;"Lady Wyndward has
some motive."</p>

<p>"Some motive?" repeated Stella, turning her eyes toward him.
"What motive can she have?"</p>

<p>"There is Leycester," he said, musingly.</p>

<p>"Leycester?"</p>

<p>The word was out of her lips before she was aware of it, and a
vivid crimson dyed her face.</p>

<p>"Lord Leycester, I mean."</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered. "Nothing would please his mother
more than to see him marry, and he could not marry a more
suitable person than Lenore. Yes, that must be it, of course.
Well, he could not do better, and as for her, though she has refused
greater chances, there is a charm in being the future<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Countess of Wyndward, which is not to be despised. I wonder
whether he will fall into the trap&mdash;if trap it is intended to be."</p>

<p>Stella sat silent, her head thrown back, her eyes fixed on the
stars. He saw she was very pale, and there was a strange, intent
look in her eyes. There was also a dull aching in her heart
which was scarcely distinct enough for pain, but which annoyed
and shamed her. What could it matter to her&mdash;to her, Stella
Etheridge, the niece of a poor painter&mdash;whom Lord Leycester,
future Earl of Wyndward, married? Nothing, less than nothing.
But still the dull aching throbbed in her heart, and his face
floated between her and the stars, his voice rang in her ears.</p>

<p>How fortunate, how blessed, some women were! Here, for
instance, was this girl of twenty-three, beautiful, famously beautiful,
noble, and reigning like a queen in the great world, and
yet the gods were not satisfied, but they must give her Leycester
Wyndward! For of course it was impossible that he should
resist her if she chose to put forth her charm. Had not her
uncle just said that she could fascinate?&mdash;had she not even evidently
fascinated him, the dreamer, the artist, the man who had
seen and who knew the world so well?</p>

<p>For a moment she gave herself up to this reflection and to the
dull aching, then with a gesture of impatience she rose, so suddenly
as to startle the old man.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Stella?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing, nothing," she said. "Shall we have lights? The
room is so dark and still, and&mdash;&mdash;" her voice broke for a moment.</p>

<p>She went to the mantel-shelf and lit a candle, and as she did
so she looked up and saw her face reflected in the antique mirror
and started.</p>

<p>Was that her face?&mdash;that pale, half-startled visage looking at
her so sadly. With a laugh she put the dark hair from her
brow, and gliding to the organ began to play; feverishly, restlessly
at first, but presently the music worked its charm and
soothed her savage breast.</p>

<p>Yes, she was savage, she knew it, she felt it! This woman
had everything, while she&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The door opened and a stream of light broke in from the lamp
carried by Mrs. Penfold.</p>

<p>"Are you there, Miss Stella? Oh, yes, there you are! I
thought it was Mr. Etheridge playing; you don't often play like
that. There's a note for you."</p>

<p>"A note! For me!" exclaimed Stella, turning on her stool
with amazement.</p>

<p>Mrs. Penfold smiled and nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes, miss; and there's an answer, please."</p>

<p>Stella took the note hesitatingly, as if she half expected it to
contain a charge of explosive dynamite; the envelope was addressed
in a thin, beautiful hand to Miss Stella Etheridge.
Stella turned the envelope over and started as she saw the arms
stamped upon it. She knew it, it was the Wyndward crest.</p>

<p>For a moment she sat looking down at it without offering to
open it, then with an effort she tore it open, slowly, and read
the note enclosed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Miss Etheridge</span>:&mdash;Will you redeem the promise you
made me this afternoon and come and see me? Will you ask
Mr. Etheridge to bring you to dine with them to-morrow at
eight o'clock? I say 'them' because I dine always alone; but
perhaps you will not mind coming to me after dinner for a little
while. Do not let Mr. Etheridge refuse as he generally does, but
tell him to bring you for my sake."</p>

<p>
"Yours very truly,<br />
<br />
"<span class="smcap">Lilian Wyndward</span>."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Stella read it and re-read it as if she could not believe her
senses. Lady Lilian's invitation had sounded so vague that she
had scarcely remembered it, and now here was a direct invitation
to Wyndham Hall, and to dinner.</p>

<p>"Well, miss?" said Mrs. Penfold.</p>

<p>Stella started.</p>

<p>"I will give you the answer directly," she said.</p>

<p>Then she went across to her uncle and stood beside him, the
letter in her hand. He was lost in thought, and quite unsuspicious
of the thunder-clap preparing for him.</p>

<p>"Uncle, I have just got a letter."</p>

<p>"Eh? Where from, Stella?"</p>

<p>"From Lady Lilian."</p>

<p>He looked up quickly.</p>

<p>"She has asked me to dinner to-morrow."</p>

<p>"No!" he said. She put the letter in his hand. "Read it,
will you, my dear?" he said.</p>

<p>And she read it, conscious that her voice trembled.</p>

<p>"Well?" he said.</p>

<p>"Well?" she repeated, with a smile.</p>

<p>He put his hand to his brow.</p>

<p>"To dinner&mdash;to-morrow? Oh, dear me! Well, well! You
would like to go?" and he looked up at her. "Of course you
would like to go."</p>

<p>She looked down, her face was delicately flushed&mdash;her eyes
shone.</p>

<p>"Of course," he said. "Well, say 'Yes.' It is very kind.
You see, Stella, your wish is gratified almost as soon as you utter
it. You will see your paragon&mdash;Lady Lenore."</p>

<p>She started, and her face went pale.</p>

<p>"I have changed my mind," she said, in a low voice. "I find
I don't want to see her so badly as I thought. I think I don't
care to go, uncle."</p>

<p>He stared at her. She was still an enigma to him.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, child! Not care to see Wyndward Hall! Nonsense!
Besides, it's Lady Lilian; we must go, Stella."</p>

<p>She still stood with the letter in her hand.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but, uncle&mdash;I have nothing to wear."</p>

<p>"Nothing to wear!" And he looked at her up and down.</p>

<p>"Nothing fit for Wyndward Hall," she said. "Uncle, I don't
think I care to go."</p>

<p>He laughed gently.</p>

<p>"You will find something to wear between now and half-past<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
seven to-morrow," he said, "or my faith in Mrs. Penfold's resources
will be shaken. Accept, my dear."</p>

<p>She went slowly to the table and wrote two lines&mdash;two lines
only.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Lady Lilian.</span>&mdash;We shall be very glad indeed to come
and see you to-morrow. Yours very truly,"</p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Stella Etheridge</span>."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Then she rang the bell and gave the note to Mrs. Penfold.</p>

<p>"I am going to Wyndward Hall to-morrow," she said, with a
smile, "and I have got nothing to wear, Mrs. Penfold!" and she
laughed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Penfold threw up her hands after the manner of her kind.</p>

<p>"To the Hall, Miss Stella, to-morrow! Oh, dear, what shall
we do?" Then she glanced at the arm-chair, and beckoned
Stella out of the room.</p>

<p>"Come up-stairs, then, and let us see what we can manage.
To the Hall! Think of that!" and she threw up her head proudly.</p>

<p>Stella sat on a chair, looking on with a smile, while the scanty
wardrobe was overhauled.</p>

<p>Scanty as it was it contained everything that was needful for
such use as Stella might ordinarily require, but a dinner at the
Hall was quite out of the ordinary. At last, after holding up
dress after dress, and dropping it with a shake of the head, Mrs.
Penfold took up a cream sateen.</p>

<p>"That's very pretty," said Stella.</p>

<p>"But it's only sateen!" exclaimed Mrs. Penfold.</p>

<p>"It looks like satin&mdash;a little," said Stella "by candlelight, at
least."</p>

<p>"And they have real satin, and silks, and velvets," deplored
Mrs. Penfold, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Nobody will notice me," said Stella, consolingly. "It doesn't
matter."</p>

<p>Mrs. Penfold glanced at her with a curious smile.</p>

<p>"Will they not, Miss Stella? I don't know, I think they will;
but it must be this dress or nothing; you can't go in a cotton, or
the black merino, and the muslin you wore the other night&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wouldn't do at all," said Stella. "We'll make this sateen
do, Mrs. Penfold. I think it looks very nice; the lace is good,
isn't it?"</p>

<p>"The lace?" said Mrs. Penfold, thoughtfully, then her face
brightened. "Wait a moment," she said, and she dropped the
dress and hurried from the room, returning in a few moments
with a small box. "Speaking of lace just reminded me, Miss
Stella, that I had some by me. It was made by my mother&mdash;I
don't know whether it's good," and as she spoke she opened the
box and lifted some lace from the interior.</p>

<p>"Why it's point!"</p>

<p>"Point, is it, miss? I didn't know. Then it is good."</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed Stella&mdash;"it's beautiful, delicious, heavenly.
And will you lend it to me?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, I'll give it to you if you will take it, Miss Stella," said the
good woman, with a proud smile.</p>

<p>"No, no, not for worlds, but I will wear it if you'll let me?"
said Stella, and she took a long strip and put it round her throat.
"Oh, it is beautiful, beautiful! It would make the poorest dress
look handsome! I will take great care of it, indeed I will."</p>

<p>"What nonsense, dear Miss Stella! How glad I am I thought
of it. And it does look pretty now you wear it," and she looked
at the beautiful face admiringly. "And you'll want gloves&mdash;let
me see&mdash;yes, you have got some cream gloves; they'll go with
the dress, won't they? Now, you go down-stairs, and I'll look
the things out and tack the lace on. Going to the Hall? I'm so
glad, Miss Stella."</p>

<p>"Are you?" said Stella, softly, as she went down-stairs, "I
don't know whether I'm glad or sorry!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> great clock in the Hall stables chimed the half-hour&mdash;half-past
seven, and the sound came floating down the valley.</p>

<p>Mr. Etheridge stood at the door clad in evening dress, which,
old-fashioned and well-worn as it was, sat upon him with a
gracious air, and made him look more distinguished than ever.
The fly was waiting at the door, and he glanced at his watch
and took a step toward the stairs, when a light appeared above,
and a light step sounded over his head. The next moment a
vision, as it seemed to him, floated into sight, and came down
upon him.</p>

<p>Stella was in the cream sateen dress&mdash;the exquisite lace was
clinging round her slender, graceful throat&mdash;there was a red rose
in her hair; but it was not the dress, nor the lace, nor the rose
even, which chained the painter's eye&mdash;it was the lovely girlish
face. The excitement had brought a dash of warm color in the
clear olive cheeks and a bright light into the dark eyes; the lips
were half-apart with a smile, and the whole face was eloquent
of youth's fresh tide of life and spirits. If they had had all
Howell and James' stock to choose from, they could not have
chosen a more suitable dress&mdash;a more becoming color; the whole
made a fitting frame for the girlish beauty.</p>

<p>"Well, uncle!" she said, with a little blush.</p>

<p>"What have you done to yourself, my child?" he said, with
simple open-eyed wonder.</p>

<p>"Isn't she&mdash;isn't it beautiful?" murmured Mrs. Penfold, in an
ecstasy. "But then, if it had been a morning cotton, it would
have been all the same." And she proceeded to wrap a woolen
shawl round her so carefully as if she was something that might
be destroyed at too hard a touch. "Mind she has this wound
round her like this when she comes out, sir, and be sure and
keep the window up."</p>

<p>"And don't let the air breathe on me, or I shall melt, uncle,"
laughed Stella.</p>

<p>"Upon my word, I'm half disposed to think so," he muttered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>Then they entered the fly&mdash;Mrs. Penfold disposing the short
train of the despised sateen with gingerly care&mdash;and started.</p>

<p>"How have you managed it all?" asked the old man, quite
bewildered. "I feel quite strange conveying a brilliant young
lady."</p>

<p>"And I feel&mdash;frightened out of my life," said Stella, with a
little breath and a laugh.</p>

<p>"Then you conceal your alarm with infinite art," he retorted.</p>

<p>"That's just it," she assented. "My heart is beating like a
steam hammer, but, like an Indian at the stake, I am determined
to smile to the end. They will be very terrible, uncle,
will they not?"</p>

<p>"Who?" he asked.</p>

<p>"The countess and the paragon&mdash;I mean Lady Lenore Beauchamp.
I shall have to be careful, or I shall be calling her the
paragon to her face. What would she do, uncle?"</p>

<p>"Smile and pass it by with a gracious air," he said, laughing.
"You are a clever and a bold girl, Stella, but even you could
not take 'a rise,' as we used to say in my school-days, out of
Lady Lenore."</p>

<p>"I am not clever, and I am trembling like a mouse," said
Stella, with a piteous little pout. "You'll stand by me, uncle,
won't you?"</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>"I think you are quite able to defend yourself, my dear," he
said. "Never knew one of your sex who was not."</p>

<p>The fly rumbled over the bridge and entered the long avenue,
and Stella, looking out, saw the lights of the house shining at
the end of the vista.</p>

<p>"What a grand place it is," she murmured, almost to herself.
"Uncle, I feel as if I were about to enter another world; and I
am, I think. I have never seen a countess in my life before;
have been shut up within the four walls of a school. If she says
one word to me I shall expire."</p>

<p>He laughed, and began to feel for the sketch which he had
brought with him.</p>

<p>"You will not find her so very terrible," he said.</p>

<p>The fly got to the end of the avenue at last, and wound round
the broad drive to the front entrance.</p>

<p>It loomed so large and awe-inspiring above them, that Stella's
heart seemed to sink; but her color came again as two tall footmen,
in grand, but not gorgeous, livery, came down the broad
steps and opened the fly door. She would not let them see that
she was&mdash;afraid. Afraid; yes that was the word which described
her feelings as she was ushered into the hall, and she
looked round at its vastness.</p>

<p>There were several other footmen standing about with solemn
faces, and a maid dressed in black, with a spotless muslin cap,
came forward with what seemed to Stella solemn and stately
steps, and asked her, in almost a reverential whisper, whether
she would come up-stairs; but Stella shook her head, and was
about to unwind the shawl, when the maid, with a quick but respectful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
movement, undertook the task, going through it with
the greatest care and attention.</p>

<p>Then her uncle held his arm and she put her hand upon it, and
in the instant, as if they had been waiting and watching, though
their eyes had been fixed on the ground, two footmen drew aside
the curtains shutting off the corridor to the drawing-room, and
another footman paced slowly and with head erect before them.</p>

<p>It was all so solemn, the dim yet sufficient light, the towering
hall, with its flags and armor, the endless curtains, with their
gold fringe, that Stella was reminded of some gothic cathedral.
The white gleaming statues seemed to look down at her, as she
passed between them, with a frown of astonishment at her
audacity in entering their solemn presence, the very silence
seemed to reproach her light footsteps on the thickly-carpeted
mosaic floor.</p>

<p>She began to be overpowered, but suddenly she remembered
that she too was of ancient birth, that she was an Etheridge, and
that the man whose arm she was leaning upon was an artist, and
a great one, and she held her head erect and called the color to
her face.</p>

<p>It was not a moment too soon, for another pair of curtains
were drawn aside, and the next instant she stood on the threshold
of the drawing-room, and she heard a low but distinct voice
say&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. and Miss Etheridge."</p>

<p>She had not time to look round; she saw, as in a flash, the exquisite
room, with its shaded candles and softly-gleaming mirrors,
saw several tall, black-coated, white-chested forms of gentlemen,
and richly-dressed ladies; then she was conscious that a
tall, beautiful, and stately lady was gliding across the room
toward them, and knew it was the countess.</p>

<p>Lady Wyndward had heard the announcement and had risen
from where she was sitting with the Countess of Longford to
welcome the guests. The painter was a favorite of hers, and if
she could have had her will he would have been a frequent visitor
at the hall.</p>

<p>When Lilian had told her of her meeting with Mr. Etheridge's
niece and asked permission to invite her, she had assented at
once, expecting to see some well-subdued middle-aged woman.
Why she should have thus pictured her she could not have told;
perhaps because Mr. Etheridge was old and so subdued himself.
She had scarcely listened to Lilian's description, and Leycester
had said no word.</p>

<p>But now as she came forward and saw a young and beautiful
girl, graceful and self-possessed, dressed with perfect taste, and
looking as distinguished as if she had gone through a couple of
London seasons, when the vision of Stella, in all her fresh young
loveliness, broke upon her suddenly and unexpectedly, an infinite
surprise took possession of her, and for a moment she half
paused, but it was only for a moment, and by no change in her
face, however slight, was her surprise revealed.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Mr. Etheridge? It was so kind of you to
come. I know how great an honor this is, and I am grateful."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>This is what Stella heard in the softest, most dulcet of voices&mdash;"Kind,
grateful!" This was how a countess welcomed a poor
painter. A glow of light seemed to illumine Stella's mind. She
had expected to see a tall stately woman dressed in satin and
diamonds, and with a courtly severe manner, and instead here
was a lady with a small gentle voice and a face all softness and
kindness. In an instant she had learned her first lesson&mdash;that a
mark of high rank and breeding is pure gentleness and humility.
The queen sits beside the bed of a sick peasant; the peer thanks
the waiter who hands him his umbrella.</p>

<p>"Yes, it was very good of you to come. And this is your
niece? How do you do, Miss Etheridge? I am very glad to see
you."</p>

<p>Stella took her gloved hand, her courage came instantly, and
she raised her eyes to the beautiful, serene face, little guessing
that as she did so, the countess was filled with surprise and admiration
as the dark orbs raised.</p>

<p>"We are quite a small party," said the countess. "Nearly all
our friends have left us. We should have been in town before
this, but Lord Wyndward is detained by business."</p>

<p>As she spoke the earl approached them, and Stella saw a tall,
thin, noble-looking man bending before her as if he were expecting
a touch of her hand.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Mr. Etheridge? We have managed to entice
you from your hermitage at last, eh? How do you do, Miss
Etheridge? I hope you didn't feel the cold driving."</p>

<p>Stella smiled, and she knew why every approach was screened
by curtains.</p>

<p>The earl drew the painter aside, and the countess, just laying
her fingers on Stella's arm, guided her to the old countess of
Longford.</p>

<p>"Mr. Etheridge's niece," she said; then, to Stella, "This is
Lady Longford."</p>

<p>Stella was conscious of a pair of keen gray eyes fixed on her
face.</p>

<p>"Glad to know you, my dear," said the old lady. "Come and
sit beside me, and tell me about your uncle; he is a wonderful
man, but a very wicked one."</p>

<p>"Wicked!" said Stella.</p>

<p>"Yes, wicked," repeated the old lady, with a smile on her
wrinkled face. "All obstinate people are wicked; and he is
obstinate because he persists in hiding himself away instead of
coming into the world and consenting to be famous, as he should
be."</p>

<p>Stella's heart warmed directly.</p>

<p>"But perhaps now that you have come, you will persuade
him to leave his shell."</p>

<p>"Do you mean the cottage? I don't think anything would
persuade him to leave that. Why should he? He is quite
happy."</p>

<p>The countess looked at her.</p>

<p>"That's a sensible retort," she said. "Why should he? I
don't know&mdash;I don't know what to answer. But I owe him a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
grudge. Do you know that he has persistently refused to come
and see me, though I have almost gone on my knees to him?"</p>

<p>Stella smiled.</p>

<p>"He does not care to go anywhere," she said. "If he went
anywhere, I am sure he would come to you."</p>

<p>The old countess glanced at her approvingly.</p>

<p>"That was nicely said," she murmured. "How old are
you?"</p>

<p>"Nineteen," said Stella, simply.</p>

<p>"Then you have inherited your uncle's brains," the old lady
replied, curtly. "It is not given to every girl to say the right
thing at nineteen."</p>

<p>Stella blushed, and looked round the room.</p>

<p>There were ten or twelve persons standing and sitting about,
some of them beautiful women, exquisitely dressed, talking to
some gentlemen; but Lord Leycester was not amongst the
latter. She was conscious of that, although she scarcely knew
that she was looking for him. She wondered which was
Lady Lenore. There was a tall, fair girl leaning against the
piano, but somehow Stella did not think it was the famous
beauty.</p>

<p>The clock on the bracket struck eight, and she saw the earl
take out his watch and glance at it mechanically; and as he did
so, a voice behind her said:</p>

<p>"Dinner is served, my lady."</p>

<p>Nobody took any notice however, and the countess did not
show by sign or look that she heard. Suddenly the curtains at
the other end of the room were swung apart, and a tall form
entered.</p>

<p>Though her eyes were fixed on another part of the room, she
knew who it was, and for a moment she would not look that
way, then she directed her eyes slowly, and saw that her instinct
had not misled her.</p>

<p>It was Leycester!</p>

<p>For a moment she was conscious of a feeling of surprise. She
thought she knew him well, but in that instant he looked so
different that he seemed almost a stranger.</p>

<p>She had not seen him before in evening dress, and the change
from the velvet coat and knickerbockers to the severe, but
aristocratic, black suit struck her.</p>

<p>Like all well-made, high-bred men he looked at his best in the
dress which fashion has decreed shall be the evening costume of
gentlemen. She had thought him handsome, noble, in the easy,
careless suit of velvet, she knew that he was distinguished looking
in his suit of evening sables.</p>

<p>With his hand upon the curtain he stood, his head erect, his
eyes not eagerly, but commandingly, scanning the room.</p>

<p>She could not tell why or how she knew, but she knew that
he was looking for her.</p>

<p>Presently he sees her, and a subtle change came over his face,
it was not a smile so much as a look of satisfaction, and she
knew again that a frown would have settled on his white brow
if she whom he sought had not been there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>With a high but firm step he came across the room and stood
before her, holding out his hand.</p>

<p>"You have come," he said; "I thought you would not come.
It is very kind of Mr. Etheridge."</p>

<p>She gave him her hand without a word. She knew that the
keen gray eyes of the old lady beside her were fixed on her face.
He seemed to remember too, for in a quieter, more commonplace,
tone, he added:</p>

<p>"I am late; it is an habitual fault of mine."</p>

<p>"It is," said the old countess.</p>

<p>He turned his smile upon her.</p>

<p>"Are you going to scold me?"</p>

<p>"I am not fond of wasting my time," she said. "Come and
sit down for a minute if you can."</p>

<p>He glanced at the clock.</p>

<p>"Am I not keeping you all waiting?" he said.</p>

<p>Lady Longford shook her head.</p>

<p>"No; we are waiting for Lenore."</p>

<p>"Then she is not here!" thought Stella.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lenore!" he said, with a smile. "Well, no one will
dare to scold her."</p>

<p>As he spoke the curtain parted, and someone entered.</p>

<p>Framed by the curtain that fell behind her in crimson folds
stood a girl&mdash;not yet a woman, for all her twenty-three years&mdash;of
wonderful beauty, with deep golden hair and violet eyes.</p>

<p>Stella knew her at once from her uncle's description, but it
was not the beauty that surprised her and made her start; it was
something more than that. It was the nameless, indescribable
charm which surrounded her; it was the grace which distinguished
her figure, her very attitude.</p>

<p>She stood a moment, with a faint half-smile upon her lips,
looking round; then she glided with a peculiar movement, that
struck Stella as grace itself, to Lady Wyndward, and bent her
head down to the countess.</p>

<p>Stella could not hear what she said, but she knew that she was
apologizing for her tardiness by the way the earl, who was standing
by, smiled at her. Yes, evidently Lady Lenore would not
be scolded for keeping dinner waiting.</p>

<p>Stella sat watching her; she felt her eyes riveted to her in
fact, and suddenly she was aware that the violet eyes were fixed
on hers.</p>

<p>She saw the beautiful lips move, saw the earl make answer,
and then watched them move together across the room.</p>

<p>Whither were they going? To her surprise they came toward
her and stopped in front of her.</p>

<p>"Miss Etheridge," said the earl, in his low, subdued voice,
"let me introduce Lady Lenore Beauchamp to you."</p>

<p>Stella looked up, and met the violet eyes fixed on her.</p>

<p>For a moment she was speechless; the eyes, so serene and full
and commanding, seemed to seek out her soul and to read every
thought it held; to read it so closely and clearly that her own
eyes dropped; then with an effort she held out her hand, and as
the great beauty's closed softly over it she raised her lids again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
and so they stood looking at each other, and Lord Leycester
stood beside with the characteristic smile on his face.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> Stella looked up at the great beauty, she felt for the
first time that her own dress, pretty as it was, was only
sateen. She had not been conscious of it before, but she felt
it now in the presence of this exquisitely-dressed woman. In
very truth, Lady Lenore was well-dressed; it was not only that
her costumes came from Redfern's or Worth's, and her millinery
from Louise, but Lenore had acquired the art of wearing the
productions of these artistes. When looking at her, one was
forcibly reminded of the Frenchman's saying, that the world
was divided into two classes&mdash;the people who were clothed
and the people who wore their clothes. Lady Lenore belonged
to those who wear their clothes; the beautiful dress sat upon her
as if she had been made to it, instead of it to her; not a piece of
lace, not a single article of jewelry, but sat in its place gracefully
and artistically.</p>

<p>To-night she wore a dress composed of some soft and readily-draping
material, neither cashmere nor satin&mdash;some one of the
new materials which have come over from the far east, and
of which we scarcely yet know the names. It was of the
most delicate shade of grayish-blue, which was brought out
and accentuated by the single camellia resting amidst the soft
lace on her bosom. The arms were bare from the elbows,
exquisitely, warmly white and beautifully formed; one heavy
bracelet, set with huge Indian pearls, lined the wrist; there
were similar huge pearls in the rings on her fingers, and in
the pendant which hung by a seed-pearl necklace.</p>

<p>Imagine a beautiful, an almost faultlessly-beautiful face, rising
from the delicate harmony of color&mdash;imagine a pair of dark
eyes, now blue, now violet, as she stood in repose or smiled, and
fringed, by long, silken lashes&mdash;and you may imagine the bare
material outward beauty of Lenore Beauchamp, but no words
can describe what really was the charm of the face&mdash;its wonderful
power of expression, its eloquent mobility, which, even when
the eyes and lips were in repose, drew you to watching and
waiting for them to speak.</p>

<p>Stella, though she had scarcely heard those lips utter a word
knew what her uncle meant when he said that there was a peculiar
fascination about her which went beyond her mere beauty;
and, as she looked, a strange feeling crossed Stella's mind. She
remembered an old story which she had heard years ago, when
she was sitting on the lap of her Italian nurse&mdash;the story of the
strange and beautiful Indian serpent which sits beneath the tree,
and fixing its eyes upon the bird overhead, draws and charms
it with its spell, until the bird drops senseless and helpless to its
fate.</p>

<p>But even as she thought of this she was ashamed of the idea,
for there is nothing serpent-like in Lenore's beauty; only this
Stella thought, that if ever those eyes and lips smiled and murmured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
to a man "I love you," that man must drop; resistance
would be vain and useless.</p>

<p>All this takes long to write; it flashed across Stella's mind in
a moment, even as they looked at each other in silence; then at
last Lady Lenore spoke.</p>

<p>"Have you been gathering primroses to-day?" she said, with
a smile.</p>

<p>It was a strange way of beginning an acquaintance, and Stella
felt the color mount to her face; the words recalled the whole of
the scene of yesterday morning. The speaker intended that they
should.</p>

<p>"No," she said, "not to-day."</p>

<p>"Miss Etheridge gathered enough yesterday for a week, did
you not?" said Lord Leycester, and the voice sounded to Stella
like an assistance. She half glanced at him gratefully, and
met his eyes fixed on her with a strange light in them that
caused hers to drop again.</p>

<p>"I must find this wonderful flower-land," said Lady Lenore.
"Lilian was quite eloquent about it last night."</p>

<p>"We shall be happy to act as pioneers in the discovery," he
said, and Stella could not help noticing the "we." Did he mean
she and he?</p>

<p>At that moment Lady Wyndward came toward them, and
murmured something to him, and he left them and offered his
arm to a lady at the other end of the room; then Lady Wyndward
waved her fan slightly and smiled, and a tall, thin, fair-haired
man came up.</p>

<p>"Lord Charles, will you take charge of Miss Etheridge?"</p>

<p>Lord Guildford bowed and offered his arm.</p>

<p>"I shall be delighted," he said, and he smiled down at Stella
in his frank way.</p>

<p>There was a general movement, ladies and gentlemen were
pairing off and moving toward the door, beside which stood the
two footmen, with the solemn air of soldiers attending an execution.</p>

<p>"Seven minutes late," said Lord Charles, glancing up at the
clock as they passed. "We must chalk that up to Lady Lenore.
I admire and envy her courage, don't you, Miss Etheridge? I
should no more dare to be late for dinner at Wyndward than&mdash;than&mdash;what's
the most audacious thing you can think of?"</p>

<p>Stella smiled; there was something catching in the light-hearted,
frank, and free tones of the young viscount.</p>

<p>"Standing on a sofa in muddy boots has always been my idea
of a great social crime," she said.</p>

<p>He laughed approvingly, and his laugh seemed to float lightly
through the quiet room.</p>

<p>"That's good&mdash;that's awfully good!" he said, with intense enjoyment.
"Standing on a sofa&mdash;that's awfully good! Must tell
Leycester that! Did you ever do it, by the way?"</p>

<p>"Never," said Stella, gravely, but with a smile.</p>

<p>"No!" he said. "Do you know I think you are capable of it
if you were provoked?"</p>

<p>"Provoked?" said Stella.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dared, I mean," he explained. "You know we used to have
a game at school called 'Dare him?' I expect all fellows have
played it. One fellow does the most extraordinary things and
dares the other fellows to do it. Leycester used to play it best.
He was a regular good hand at it. The worst of it was that we
all used to get thrashed; the masters didn't care about half-a-dozen
fellows flinging stones at the windows and climbing on to
the roof at the dead of night."</p>

<p>"Poor masters!" said Stella.</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>"Yes, they didn't have a particularly fine time of it when
Leycester was at school."</p>

<p>As he spoke, he glanced at the tall figure of Lord Leycester in
front of them with an admiring air such as a school-boy might
wear.</p>

<p>"There isn't much that Leycester wouldn't dare," he said.</p>

<p>They entered the dining-room, a large room lined with oak
and magnificently furnished, in which the long table with its
snowy cloth, and glittering plate and glass, shone out conspicuously.</p>

<p>Lord Guildford found no difficulty in discovering their seats,
each place being distinguished by a small tablet bearing the
name of the intended occupant. As Stella took her seat, she
noticed a beautiful bouquet beside her serviette, and saw that
one was placed for every lady in the room.</p>

<p>A solemn, stately butler, who looked like a bishop, stood beside
the earl's chair, and with a glance and a slight movement
of his hand directed the noiseless footmen.</p>

<p>A clergyman said grace, and the dinner commenced. Stella,
looking round, saw that her uncle was seated near Lady Wyndward,
and that Lady Lenore was opposite herself. She looked
round for Lord Leycester, and was startled to hear his voice at
her left. He was speaking to Lady Longford. As she turned to
look at him she happened to catch Lady Wyndward's eye also
fixed upon him with a strange expression, and wondered what it
meant; the next moment she knew, for, bending his head and
looking straight before him, he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you like your flowers?"</p>

<p>Stella took up the bouquet; it was composed almost entirely
of white blossoms, and smelt divinely.</p>

<p>"They are beautiful," she said. "Heliotrope and camellias&mdash;my
favorite flowers."</p>

<p>"It must have been instinct," he said.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I chose them," he said, in the same low voice.</p>

<p>"Chose them?" she retorted.</p>

<p>"Yes," and he smiled. "That was what made me late. I
came in here first and had a grand review of the bouquets. I
was curious to know if I could guess your favorite flowers."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you&mdash;changed them!" said Stella, with a feeling of
mild horror. "Lord Guildford asked me just now what I considered
the most audacious act a man would commit. I know
now."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>"I changed something else," he said.</p>

<p>Stella looked at him inquiringly. There was a bold smile in
his dark eyes.</p>

<p>He pointed to the little tablet bearing his name.</p>

<p>"This. I found it over the way there, next to that old lady in
the emeralds. She is a dreadful old lady&mdash;beware of her. She
is a politician, and she always asks everybody who comes near
her what they think of the present Parliament. I thought it
would be nicer to come over here."</p>

<p>The color crept slowly into Stella's face, and her eyes dropped.</p>

<p>"It was very wrong," she said. "I am sure Lady Wyndward
will be angry. How could you interfere with the arrangements?
They all seem so solemn and grand to me."</p>

<p>He laughed softly.</p>

<p>"They are. We always eat our meals as if they were the last
we could expect to have&mdash;as if the executioner was waiting outside
and feeling the edge of the ax impatiently. There is only
one man here who dares to laugh outright."</p>

<p>"Who is that?" asked Stella.</p>

<p>He nodded to Lord Guildford, who was actively engaged in
bending his head over his soup with the air of a hungry man.
"Charlie," he said&mdash;"Lord Guildford, I mean. He laughs everywhere,
don't you, Charlie?"</p>

<p>"Eh? Yes, oh, yes. What is he telling you about me, Miss
Etheridge? Don't believe a word he says. I mean to have him
up for libel some day."</p>

<p>"He says you laugh everywhere," said Stella.</p>

<p>Lord Charles laughed at once, and Stella looked round half
alarmed, but nobody seemed to faint or show any particular
horror.</p>

<p>"Nobody minds him," said Lord Leycester, balancing his
spoon. "He is like the King's Jester, licensed to play wheresoever
he pleases."</p>

<p>"I'm fearfully hungry," said Lord Charles. "I've been in the
saddle since three o'clock&mdash;is that the <i>menu</i>, Miss Etheridge?
Let us mark our favorite dishes," and he offered her a half-hold
of the porcelain tablet on which was written the items of the
various courses.</p>

<p>Stella looked down the long list with something like amused
dismay.</p>

<p>"It's dreadfully long," she said. "I don't think I have any
favorite dishes."</p>

<p>"No; not really!" he demanded. "What a treat! Will you
really let me advise you?"</p>

<p>"I shall be most grateful," said Stella.</p>

<p>"Oh, this is charming," said Lord Guildford. "Next to
choosing one's own dinner, there is nothing better than choosing
one for someone else. Let me see;" and thereupon he made a
careful selection, which Stella broke into with an amused laugh.</p>

<p>"I could not possibly eat all these things," she said.</p>

<p>"Oh, but you must," he said. "Why, I have been most careful
to pick out only those dishes suitable for a lady's delicate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
appetite; you can't leave one of them out, you can't, indeed,
without spoiling your dinner."</p>

<p>"My dear," said the countess, bending forward, "don't let
him teach you anything, except to take warning by his epicureanism;
he is only anxious that you should be too occupied to
disturb him."</p>

<p>Lord Charles laughed.</p>

<p>"That is cruel," he said. "You take my advice, Miss Etheridge;
there are only two things I understand, and those are a
horse and a good dinner."</p>

<p>Meanwhile the dinner was proceeding, and to Stella it seemed
that "good" scarcely adequately described it. One elaborate
course after another followed in slow succession, borne in by the
richly-liveried footmen on the massive plate for which Wyndward
Hall was famous. Dishes which she had never heard of
seemed to make their appearance only to pass out again untouched,
excepting by the clergyman, Lord Guildford, and one
or two other gentlemen. She noticed that the earl scarcely
touched anything beyond a tiny piece of fish and a mutton cutlet;
and Lord Guildford, who seemed to take an interest in anything
connected with the dinner, remarked, as he glanced at the
stately head of the house&mdash;</p>

<p>"There is one other person present who is of your way of
thinking, Miss Etheridge&mdash;I mean the earl. He doesn't know
what a good dinner means. I don't suppose he will taste anything
more than the fish and a piece of Cheshire. When he is
in town and at work&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"At work? said Stella.</p>

<p>"In the House of Lords, you know; he is a member of the
Cabinet."</p>

<p>Stella nodded.</p>

<p>"He is a statesman?"</p>

<p>"Exactly. He generally dines off a mutton chop served in
the library. I've seen him lunching off a penny biscuit and a
glass of water. Terrible, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Stella laughed.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he finds he can work better on a chop and a glass of
water," she said.</p>

<p>"Don't believe it!" retorted Lord Guildford. "No man can
work well unless he is well-fed."</p>

<p>"Guildford ought to know," said Lord Leycester, audibly.
"He does so much work."</p>

<p>"So I do," retorts Lord Charles. "Stay and keep you in order,
and if that isn't hard work I don't know what is!"</p>

<p>This was very amusing for Stella; it was all so strange, too,
and so little what she imagined; here were two peers talking
like school-boys for her amusement, as if they were mere nobodies
and she were somebody worth amusing.</p>

<p>Every now and then she could hear Lady Lenore's voice, musical
and soft, yet full and distinct; she was talking of the coming
season, and Stella heard her speak of great people&mdash;persons'
names which she had read of, but never expected to hear spoken
of so familiarly. It seemed to her that she had got into some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
charmed circle; it scarcely seemed real. Then occasionally,
but very seldom, the earl's thin, clear, high-bred voice would be
heard, and once he looked across at Stella herself, and said:</p>

<p>"Will you not try some of those rissoles, Miss Etheridge?
They are generally very good."</p>

<p>"And he never touches them," murmured Lord Charles, with
a mock groan.</p>

<p>She could hear her uncle talking also&mdash;talking more fluently
than was his wont&mdash;to Lady Wyndward, who was speaking
about the pictures, and once Stella saw her glance in her direction
as if they had been speaking of her. The dinner seemed
very long, but it came to an end at last, and the countess rose.
As Stella rose with the rest of the ladies, the old Countess of
Longford locked her arm in hers.</p>

<p>"I am not so old that I can't walk, and I am not lame, my
dear," she said, "but I like something young and strong to lean
upon; you are both. You don't mind?"</p>

<p>"No!" said Stella. "Yes, I am strong."</p>

<p>The old countess looked up at her with a glance of admiration
in her gray eyes.</p>

<p>"And young," she said significantly.</p>

<p>They passed into a drawing-room&mdash;not the one they had entered
first, but a smaller room which bore the name of "my
lady's." It was exquisitely furnished in the modern antique
style. There were some beautiful hangings that covered the
walls, and served as background for costly cabinets and brackets,
upon which was arranged a collection of ancient china second to
none in the kingdom. The end of the room opened into a fernery,
in which were growing tall palms and whole miniature forests
of maidenhair, kept moist by sparkling fountains that fell
with a plash, plash, into marble basins. Birds were twitting
and flitting about behind a wire netting, so slight and carefully
concealed as to be scarcely perceptible.</p>

<p>No footman was allowed to enter this ladies' paradise; two
maids, in their soft black dresses and snowy caps, were moving
about arranging a table for the countess to serve tea upon.</p>

<p>It was like a scene from the "Arabian Nights," only more
beautiful and luxurious than anything Stella had imagined even
when reading that wonderful book of fairy-tales.</p>

<p>The countess went straight to her table and took off her gray-white
gloves, some of the ladies settled themselves in the most
indolent of attitudes on the couches and chairs, and others
strolled into the fern house. The old countess made herself
comfortable on a low divan, and made room for Stella beside
her.</p>

<p>"And this is your first visit to Wyndward Hall, my dear?" she
said.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Stella, her eyes still wandering round the
room.</p>

<p>"And you live in that little village on the other side of the
river?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Stella, again. "It is very pretty, is it not?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is, as pretty as anything in one of your uncle's pictures.
And are you quite happy?"</p>

<p>Stella brought her eyes upon the pale, wrinkled face.</p>

<p>"Happy! Oh, yes, quite," she said.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think you are," said the old lady with a keen glance at
the beautiful face and bright, pure eyes. "Then you must keep so,
my dear," she said.</p>

<p>"But isn't that rather difficult?" said Stella, with a smile.</p>

<p>Lady Longford looked at her.</p>

<p>"That serves me right for meddling," she said. "Yes, it is difficult,
very difficult, and yet the art is easy enough; it contains
only one rule, and that is 'to be content.'"</p>

<p>"Then I shall continue to be happy," said Stella; "for I am very
content."</p>

<p>"For the present," said the old lady. "Take care, my dear!"</p>

<p>Stella smiled; it was a strange sort of conversation, and there
was a suggestion of something that did not appear on the surface.</p>

<p>"Do you think that I look very discontented, then?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No," said the old lady, eying her again. "No, you look very
contented&mdash;at present. Isn't that a beautiful forest?"</p>

<p>It was an abrupt change of the subject, but Stella was equal
to it.</p>

<p>"I have been admiring it since I came in," she said; "it is like
fairy land."</p>

<p>"Go and enter it," said the old countess&mdash;"I am going to sleep
for exactly ten minutes. Will you come back to me then? You
see, I am very frank and rude; but I am very old indeed."</p>

<p>Stella rose with a smile.</p>

<p>"I think you are very kind to me," she said.</p>

<p>The old countess looked up at the beautiful face with the dark,
soft eyes bent down on her; and something like a sigh of regret
came into her old, keen eyes.</p>

<p>"You know how to make pretty speeches, my dear," she said.
"You learnt that in Italy, I expect. Mind you come back to
me."</p>

<p>Then, as Stella moved away, the old lady looked after her.</p>

<p>"Poor child!" she murmured&mdash;"poor child! she is but a child;
but he won't care. Is it too late, I wonder? But why should I
worry about it?"</p>

<p>But it seemed as if she must worry about it, whatever it was,
for after a few minutes' effort to sleep, she rose and went across
to the tea-table.</p>

<p>Lady Wyndward was making tea, but looked up and pushed a
chair close beside her.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she asked, with a smile.</p>

<p>"Who is she?" asked the countess, taking a cup and stirring the
tea round and round, very much as Betty the washerwoman does&mdash;very
much indeed.</p>

<p>Lady Wyndward did not ask "Who?" but replied in her serene,
placid voice directly:</p>

<p>"I don't know. Of course, I know that she is Mr. Etheridge's
niece, but I don't know anything about her, except that she has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
just come here from Italy. She said that she was not happy
there."</p>

<p>"She is very beautiful," murmured the countess.</p>

<p>"She is&mdash;very," assented Lady Wyndward.</p>

<p>"And something more than distinguished. I never saw a
more graceful girl. She is only a child, of course."</p>

<p>"Quite a child," assented Lady Wyndward again.</p>

<p>There was a pause, then the old countess said, almost abruptly:</p>

<p>"Why is she here?"</p>

<p>Lady Wyndward filled a cup carefully before replying.</p>

<p>"She is a friend of Lilian's," she said; "at least she invited
her."</p>

<p>"I thought she was rather a friend of Leycester's," said the
old lady, dryly.</p>

<p>Lady Wyndward looked at her, and a faint, a very faint color
came into her aristocratic face.</p>

<p>"You mean that he has noticed her?" she said.</p>

<p>"Very much! I sat next to him at dinner. Was it wise to put
him next to her? A child's head is quickly turned."</p>

<p>"I did not arrange it so," replied Lady Wyndward. "I put
his tablet next to Lenore's, as usual; but it got moved. I don't
know who could have done it."</p>

<p>"I do," said the old lady. "It was Leycester himself. I
am sure of it by the way he looked."</p>

<p>Lady Wyndward's white brow contracted for a moment.</p>

<p>"It is like him. He will do or dare anything for an hour's
amusement. I ought to be angry with him!"</p>

<p>"Be as angry as you like, but don't let him know that you are,"
said the old lady, shrewdly.</p>

<p>Lady Wyndward understood.</p>

<p>"How beautiful Lenore looks to-night," she said, looking
across the room where Lady Lenore stood fanning herself, her
head thrown back, her eyes fixed on a picture.</p>

<p>"Yes," assented the old countess. "If I were a man I should
not rest until I had won her; if I were a man&mdash;but then men are
so different to what we imagine them. They turn aside from a
garden lily to pluck a wayside flower&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But they come back to the lily," said Lady Wyndward, with
a smile.</p>

<p>"Yes," muttered the old countess, suavely; "after they have
grown tired of the wild flower and thrown it aside."</p>

<p>As she spoke the curtains were withdrawn and the gentlemen
came sauntering in.</p>

<p>No one rests long over the wine, nowadays; the earl scarcely
drank a glass after the ladies left; he would fill his glass&mdash;fill
two perhaps, but rarely did more than sip them. Lord Leycester
would take a bumper of claret&mdash;the cellars were celebrated for
the Chateau Margaux. To-night it seemed as if he had taken
an additional one, for there was a deeper color on his face,
and a brighter light in his eyes than usual; the light which
used to shine there in his school-days, when there was some
piece of wildness on, more mad than usual. Lord Guildford came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
in leaning lightly upon his arm, and he was talking to him in a
low voice.</p>

<p>"One of the most beautiful faces I have ever seen, Ley: not
your regular cut-out-to-pattern kind of face, but fresh and&mdash;and&mdash;natural.
The sort of face Venus might have had when she
rose from the sea that fine morning&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Lord Leycester, with a slight start, and he
thought of the picture in his room, the picture of the Venus
with the pale, fair face, across which he had drawn the defacing
brush that night he had come home from his meeting
with Stella. "Hush! they will hear you! Yes, she is beautiful."</p>

<p>"Yes, beautiful! Take care, take care, Ley!" muttered Lord
Charles.</p>

<p>Leycester put his hand from him with a smile.</p>

<p>"You talk in parables to-night, Charlie, and don't provide the
key. Go and get some tea."</p>

<p>He went himself toward the table and got a cup, but his eyes
wandered round the room, and the old countess and Lady Wyndward
noticed the searching glance.</p>

<p>"Leycester," said his mother, "will you ask Lenore to sing
for us?"</p>

<p>He put down his cup and went down the room to where she
was sitting beside the earl.</p>

<p>"My mother has sent me as one of her ambassadors to
the queen of music," he said. "Will your majesty deign to sing
for us?"</p>

<p>She looked up at him with a smile, then gave her cup to one
of the maids, and put her hand upon his arm.</p>

<p>"Do you know that this is the first time you have spoken
to me since&mdash;since&mdash;I cannot remember?"</p>

<p>"One does not dare intrude upon royalty too frequently; it
would be presumptuous," he said.</p>

<p>"In what am I royal?" she asked.</p>

<p>"In your beauty!" he said, and he was the only man in the
room who would have dared so pointed a reply.</p>

<p>"Thanks," she said, with a calm smile; "you are very frank
to-night."</p>

<p>"Am I? And why not? We do not hesitate to call the summer
sky blue or the ocean vast. There are some things so palpable
and generally acknowledged that to be reserved about
them would be absurd."</p>

<p>"That will do," she said. "Since when have you learnt such
eloquent phrases? What shall I sing, or shall I sing at all?"</p>

<p>"To please me you have but to sing to please yourself!" he
said.</p>

<p>"Find me something then," she said, and sat down with her
hands folded, looking a very queen indeed.</p>

<p>He knelt down beside the canterbury, and, as at a signal, there
was a general gathering round the piano, but she still sat calm
and unconscious, very queen-like indeed.</p>

<p>Leycester found a song, and set it up for her, opened the
piano, took her bouquet from her lap, and waited for her gloves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the rest looking on as if interference were quite out of the question.</p>

<p>Slowly she removed her gloves and gave them to him, touched
the piano with her jeweled fingers, and began to sing.</p>

<p>At this moment Stella, who had been wandering round the
fernery, came back to the entrance, and stood listening and absorbed.</p>

<p>She had never heard so beautiful a voice, not even in Italy.
But presently, even while a thrill of admiration was running
through her, she became conscious that there was something
wanting. Her musical sense was unsatisfied. The notes were
clear, bell-like, and as harmonious as a thrush's, the modulation
perfect; but there was something wanting. Was it heart?
From where she stood she could see the lovely face, with its dark
violet eyes upturned, its eloquent mouth curved to allow the
music vent, and the loveliness held her inthralled, though the
voice did not move her.</p>

<p>The song came to an end, and the singer sat with a calm smile
receiving the murmurs of gratitude and appreciation, but she
declined to sing again, and Stella saw Lord Leycester hand her
her gloves and bouquet and stand ready to conduct her whither
she would.</p>

<p>"He stands like her slave, to obey her slightest wish," she
thought. "Ah! how happy she must be," and with a something
that was almost a sigh, she turned back into the dim calm of the
fernery; she felt strangely alone and solitary at that moment.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a step behind her, and looking up she saw
Lord Leycester.</p>

<p>"I have found you!" he said, and there was a ring of satisfaction
and pleasure in his voice that went straight to her heart.
"Where have you been hiding?"</p>

<p>She looked up at the handsome face full of life and strong
manhood, and her eyes fell.</p>

<p>"I have not been hiding," she said. "I have been here."</p>

<p>"You are right," he said, seating himself beside her; "this is
the best place; it is cool and quiet here; it is more like our
woods, is it not, with the ferns and the primroses?" and at the
"our" he smiled into her eyes.</p>

<p>"It is very lovely here," she said. "It's all lovely. How
beautifully she sings!" she added, rather irrelevantly.</p>

<p>"Sings?" he said. "Oh, Lenore! Yes, she sings well, perfectly.
And that reminds me. I have been sent to ask you to
make music for us."</p>

<p>Stella shrank back with a glance of alarm.</p>

<p>"I? Oh, no, no! I could not."</p>

<p>He smiled at her.</p>

<p>"But your uncle&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He should not!" said Stella, with a touch of crimson. "I
could not sing. I am afraid."</p>

<p>"Afraid! You?" he said. "Of what?"</p>

<p>"Of&mdash;of&mdash;everything," she said, with a little laugh. "I could
not sing before all these people. I have never done so. Besides,
to sing after Lady Lenore would be like dancing a hornpipe."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should be content if you would dance a hornpipe," he said.
"I should think it good and wise."</p>

<p>"Are you laughing at me?" she said, looking up at the dark
eyes. "Why?"</p>

<p>"Laughing at you?" he repeated. "I! I could not. It is you
who laugh at me; I think you are laughing at me most times.
You will not sing, then?"</p>

<p>"I cannot," she said.</p>

<p>"Then you shall not," he responded; "you shall not do anything
you do not like. But some time you will sing for us, will
you not? Your uncle has been telling us about your voice, and
how you came by it," and his own voice grew wonderfully
gentle.</p>

<p>"My father, he meant," said Stella, simply. "Yes; he could
sing. He was a great musician, and when I think of that, I am
inclined to resolve never to open my lips again."</p>

<p>There was a moment's pause. Stella sat pulling a piece of
maidenhair apart, her eyes downcast; his eyes were reading her
beautiful face, and noting the graceful turns of the white neck.
Someone was playing the grand piano, and the music floated in
and about the tall palms. It was an intoxicating moment for
him! The air was balmy with perfumes from the exotics, the
warm blood was running freely in his veins, the beauty of the
girl beside him seemed to entrance him. Instinctively his hand,
being idly near her, went toward hers, and would have touched
it, but suddenly one of the maids entered, and with a slow, respectful
air approached them. She held a silver salver, on which
lay a small note, folded in a lover's knot.</p>

<p>Lord Leycester looked up; the interruption came just in
time.</p>

<p>"For me?" he said.</p>

<p>"For Miss Etheridge, my lord," replied the maid, with a
courtesy.</p>

<p>"For me?" echoed Stella, taking the note.</p>

<p>"I can guess who it is from," he said, with a smile. "Lilian
is growing impatient&mdash;if she is ever that."</p>

<p>Stella unfolded the note. This was it: "Will you come to me
now, if you care to?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I will go at once," she said, standing up.</p>

<p>He rose with a sigh.</p>

<p>"It is the first time I have envied Lilian anything," he said,
in a low voice.</p>

<p>"This way, if you please, miss," said the maid.</p>

<p>"A moment&mdash;a moment only," said Lord Leycester, and as
Stella stopped, he gathered a few sprays of maidenhair from the
margin of the fountain.</p>

<p>"It is a peace-offering. Will you take it to her? I promised
that I would ask you to go directly after dinner," he said, softly.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Stella, and as she took it there rose once more in
her mind the word Jasper Adelstone had spoken&mdash;"infamous."
This man who sent his sister such a message in such a voice!</p>

<p>"Thanks," he said. "But it was scarcely necessary. I have
sent her something more beautiful, more precious."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>Stella did not understand far a moment, then as her eyes met
his, she knew that he meant herself, and the color flooded her
face.</p>

<p>"You should not say that," she said, gravely, and before he
could answer she moved away, and followed the maid.</p>

<p>The maid led her through the hall and up the broad stairs,
across the corridor and knocked at Lady Lilian's door.</p>

<p>Stella entered, and a grave peace seemed to fall upon her.</p>

<p>Lady Lilian was lying on the couch by the window, and raised
herself to hold out her hand.</p>

<p>"How good of you to come!" she said, eagerly, and as the
voice broke on Stella's ear, she knew what Lady Lenore's voice
wanted. "You think me very selfish to bring you away from
them all do you not?" she added, still holding Stella's hand in
her white, cool one.</p>

<p>"No," said Stella, "I am very glad to come. I would have
come before, but I did not know whether I might."</p>

<p>"I have been waiting, and did not like to send for you," said
Lady Lilian, "and have you had a pleasant evening?"</p>

<p>Stella sank into a low seat beside the couch, and looked up
into the lovely face with a smile.</p>

<p>"I have had a wonderful evening!" she said.</p>

<p>Lady Lilian looked at her inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Wonderful," said Stella, frankly. "You see I have never
been in such a place as this before; it all seems so grand and
beautiful&mdash;more beautiful than grand indeed, that I can scarcely
believe it is real."</p>

<p>"It is real&mdash;too real," said Lady Lilian, with a smile and a little
sigh. "I daresay you think it is very nice, and I&mdash;do you
know what I think?"</p>

<p>Stella shook her head.</p>

<p>"I think, as I look down at your little cottage, how beautiful,
how nice your life must be."</p>

<p>"Mine!" said Stella. "Well, yes, it is very nice. But this is
wonderful."</p>

<p>"Because you are not used to it," said Lady Lilian. "Ah!
you would soon get tired of it, believe me."</p>

<p>"Never," breathed Stella, looking down; as she did so she saw
the maidenhair, and held it up.</p>

<p>"Lord Leycester sent these to you," she said.</p>

<p>A loving light came into Lady Lilian's eyes as she took the
green, fragrant sprays.</p>

<p>"Leycester?" she said, touching her cheek with them. "That
is like him&mdash;he is too good to me."</p>

<p>Stella looked across the room at a picture of the Madonna rising
from the earth, with upturned, glorious eyes.</p>

<p>"Is he?" she murmured.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, yes, there never was a brother like him in all the
wide world," said Lady Lilian, in a rapt voice. "I cannot tell
you how good he is to me; he is always thinking of me&mdash;he
who has so much to think of. I fancy sometimes that people
are apt to deem him selfish and&mdash;and&mdash;thoughtless, but they do
not know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," said Stella again. The voice sounded like music in her
ears&mdash;she could have listened forever while it sung his song;
and yet that word suddenly rang out in discord, and she smiled.
"He seems very kind," she said&mdash;"he is very kind to me."</p>

<p>Lady Lilian looked at her suddenly, and an anxious expression
came into her eyes. It was not many nights ago that she had
implored Leycester to see no more of the girl with the dark eyes
and silky hair; and here was the girl sitting at her feet, and it
was her doing! She had not thought of that before; she had
been so fascinated by the fresh young beauty, by the pure, frank
eyes, that she had actually acted against her own instincts, and
brought her into Leycester's path!</p>

<p>"Yes, he is very kind to everybody," she said. "And you
have enjoyed yourself? Have they been singing?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Lady Beauchamp."</p>

<p>"Lenore," said Lilian, eagerly. "Ah, yes; does she not sing
beautifully, and is she not lovely?"</p>

<p>"She sings beautifully, and she is very lovely," said Stella,
still looking at the Madonna.</p>

<p>Lady Lilian laughed softly.</p>

<p>"I am very fond of Lenore. You will like her very much
when you know her better. She is&mdash;I was going to say&mdash;very
imperial."</p>

<p>"That would be right," said Stella; "she is like a queen, only
more beautiful than most queens have been."</p>

<p>"I am so glad you admire her," said Lady Lilian; then she
paused a moment, and her white hand fell like a thistle down on
the dark head beside her. "Shall I tell you a secret?"</p>

<p>Stella looked up, with a smile.</p>

<p>"Yes; I will promise to keep it."</p>

<p>Lilian smiled down at her.</p>

<p>"How strangely you said that&mdash;so gravely. Yes, I think you
would keep a secret to the death. But this is not one of that
sort; it is only this&mdash;that we hope, all of us, that Lenore will become
my sister."</p>

<p>Stella did not start; did not remove her eyes from the pale,
lovely face, but into those eyes a something came that was not
wonder nor pain, but a strong, indefinable expression, as if she
were holding her breath in the effort to suppress any sign of
feeling.</p>

<p>"Do you mean that Lord Leycester will marry her?" she said,
distinctly.</p>

<p>Lady Lilian nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is it. Would it not be nice?"</p>

<p>Stella smiled.</p>

<p>"For Lord Leycester?"</p>

<p>Lady Lilian laughed her soft laugh.</p>

<p>"What a strange girl you are," she said, smoothing the silky
hair. "What am I to say to that? Well&mdash;yes, of course. And
for Lenore, too," she added, with a touch of pride.</p>

<p>"Yes, for Lady Lenore also," said Stella, and her eyes went
back to the Madonna.</p>

<p>"We are all so anxious to see Leycester married," went on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Lady Lilian, with a smile. "They say he is&mdash;so wild, I think
it is, they say! Ah, they do not see him as I see him. Do
you think he is wild?"</p>

<p>Stella paled. The strain was great, her heart was beating
with suppressed throbs. The gentle girl did not know how
she was torturing her with such questions.</p>

<p>"I?" she murmured. "I do not know. I cannot tell. How
should I? I scarcely know your brother."</p>

<p>"Ah, no, I forget," said Lady Lilian. "To me it seems as if
we had known each other so long, and we only met the other
morning for a few minutes. How is it? Do you possess some
charm, and did you conceal it in the flowers you gave me, so
that I am under a spell, Stella? That is your name, isn't it?
It is a beautiful name; are you angry with me for calling you
by it?"</p>

<p>"Angry! No!" said Stella, putting up her warm, firm hand,
and touching the thin white one resting on her hair. "No, I
like you to call me by it."</p>

<p>"And you will call me by mine&mdash;Lilian?"</p>

<p>"If you wish it," said Stella. "Yes, I will."</p>

<p>"And we shall be great friends. See, I have kept your flowers
quite cool and fresh," and she pointed to a vase in which the
primroses stood at the other end of the room. "I love wild
flowers. They are Heaven's very own, are they not? No human
hand does anything for them, or helps them to grow."</p>

<p>Stella listened to the low, beautiful voice with a rapt awe.</p>

<p>Lady Lilian looked down at her with a smile.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether you would grant me a favor if I asked it?"
she said.</p>

<p>"I would do anything for you," said Stella, looking up at her.</p>

<p>"Will you go and play for me?" she said. "I know that you
can play and sing because I have looked into your eyes."</p>

<p>"Suppose I say that I cannot," said Stella, laughing softly.</p>

<p>"You cannot!" said Lady Lilian. "I am never mistaken.
Leycester says that I am a witch in such matters."</p>

<p>"Well, I will try," said Stella, and she crossed the room and
opened the tiny piano, and began to play a sonata by Schubert.</p>

<p>"I cannot play like Lady Lenore," she said, almost to herself,
but Lady Lilian heard her.</p>

<p>"You play exquisitely," she said.</p>

<p>"No, I can't play," repeated Stella, with almost a touch of
impatience; then she looked up and saw the Madonna, and on
the impulse of the moment began to sing Gounod's "Ave
Maria." There is no more exquisite piece of devotional music in
the world, and it was Stella's favorite. She had sung it often
and often in the dreary school-days, with all her longing heart
in her voice; she had sung it in solemn aisled cathedrals, while
the incense rose to the vaulted roof; but she had never sung it
as she sang it now&mdash;now that the strange, indefinable pain was
filling her heart with wistful vague longing. Lady Lilian leant
forward&mdash;her lips parted, her eyes filling with tears&mdash;so rapt that
she did not notice that the door had opened, and that Lord
Leycester stood in the room. When she did see him he held up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
his hand to silence any word of greeting, and stood with his
head lowered, his eyes fixed on Stella's face, upturned, white,
and rapt. As he listened, his handsome face grew pale, his dark
eyes deepened with intense emotion; he had stood beside the
piano down-stairs while Lady Lenore had been singing, with a
calm, polite attention; here and at this moment his heart beat
and throbbed with an intense longing to bend and kiss the upturned
face&mdash;with an intense longing to draw the eyes toward
his&mdash;to silence the exquisite voice&mdash;to change its imploring
prayer into a song of love.</p>

<p>All unconsciously Stella sang on till the end, that last, lingering,
exquisite, long-drawn sigh; then she turned and saw him,
but she did not move&mdash;only turned pale, her eyes fixed on his.
And so they looked at each other.</p>

<p>With an effort he broke the spell, and moved. But he did not
speak to her at once, but to Lilian.</p>

<p>"I have brought you something," he said, in a low voice, and
he held up the sketch.</p>

<p>Lady Lilian uttered a cry of delight.</p>

<p>"And it is for me! Oh, Leycester, that is nice! It is beautiful!
I know who painted it&mdash;it was your uncle, Stella! Oh,
yes, I know!"</p>

<p>"You are right," said Leycester, then he went toward Stella.</p>

<p>"How can I thank you?" he said, in a low voice. "I know
now why you would not sing to to us down-stairs! You were
quite right. I would not have you sing to a mob in a drawing-room
after dinner. What shall I say?&mdash;what can I say?"</p>

<p>Stella looked up pale and almost breathless beneath the passionate
fire that burned in his eyes.</p>

<p>"I did not know you were here," she said, at last.</p>

<p>"Or you would not have sung. I am glad I came&mdash;I cannot
say how glad! You will not sing again?"</p>

<p>"No, no," she said.</p>

<p>"No," he said. "I did not think you would, and yet I would
give something to hear you once&mdash;only once more."</p>

<p>"No," said Stella, and she rose and went back to her seat.</p>

<p>"Isn't it beautiful?" said Lady Lilian, in a murmur. "I have
been richly endowed to-night. Your song and this picture.
How exquisite it was! Where did you learn to sing like that?"</p>

<p>"Nowhere," said Leycester. "That cannot be learnt!"</p>

<p>Lilian looked at him; he was still pale, and his eyes seemed to
burn with suppressed eagerness.</p>

<p>"Go and thank Mr. Etheridge," she said.</p>

<p>"Presently," he said, and he came and put his hand on her
arm. "Presently! let me rest here a little while. It is Paradise
after&mdash;&mdash;" he paused.</p>

<p>"You shall not rest," she said. "Go and sing something,
Ley."</p>

<p>Then, as Stella looked up, she laughed softly.</p>

<p>"Did you not know he could sing? He is a bad, wicked, indolent
boy. He can do all sorts of things when he likes, but
he never will exert himself. He will not sing, now will you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>He stood looking at Stella, and as if constrained to speak and
look at him, Stella raised her eyes.</p>

<p>"Will you sing?" she said, almost inaudibly.</p>

<p>As if waiting for her command, he bent his head and went to
the piano.</p>

<p>His fingers strayed over the notes slowly for a moment or two,
then he said, without turning his head:</p>

<p>"Have you seen these flowers?"</p>

<p>Stella did not wish to move; but the voice seemed to draw her,
and she rose and crossed to the piano.</p>

<p>He looked up.</p>

<p>"Stay," he murmured.</p>

<p>She hesitated a second, then stood with downcast eyes, which,
hidden as they were, seemed to feel his ardent gaze fixed upon
her.</p>

<p>He still touched the keys gently, and then, without further
prelude, he began in a low voice:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I wandered down the valley in the eventide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The birds were singing sweetly in the summer air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The river glided murm'ring to the ocean wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But still no peace was there;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For love lay lurking in the ferny brake;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw him lying with his bow beside;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He cried, 'Sweetheart, we will never, never part!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the river in the valley at the eventide.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I fled to the mountains, to the clouds and mist,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the eagle and the hawk share their solitary throne;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Here at least,' I cried, 'wicked love I can deride,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He will leave me here at peace alone.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But love lay lurking in the clouds and mist;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I heard him singing sweetly on the mountain side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">''Tis all in vain you fly, for everywhere am I,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In every quiet valley, on every mountain side.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>With his eyes fixed on hers, he sang as if every word were addressed
to her; his voice was like a flute, mellow and clear, and
musical, but it was not the voice but the words that seemed to
sink into Stella's heart as she listened. It seemed to her as if
he dared her to fly, to seek safety from him&mdash;his love, he seemed
to say, would pursue her in every quiet valley, on every mountain
side.</p>

<p>For a moment she forgot Lady Lenore, forgot everything; she
felt helpless beneath the spell of those dark eyes, the musical
voice; her head drooped, her eyes closed.</p>

<p>"'Tis all in vain you fly, for everywhere am I, in every quiet
valley, on every mountain side."</p>

<p>Was it to be so with her? Would his presence haunt her ever
and everywhere?</p>

<p>With a start she turned from him and glided swiftly to the
couch as if seeking protection.</p>

<p>Lady Lilian looked at her.</p>

<p>"You are tired," she said.</p>

<p>"I think I am," said Stella.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>"Leycester take her away; I will not have her wearied,
or she will not come again. You will come again, will you
not?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Stella, "I will come again."</p>

<p>Lord Leycester stood beside the open door, but Lilian still
clung to her hand.</p>

<p>"Good-night," she said, and she put up her face.</p>

<p>Stella bent and kissed her.</p>

<p>"Good-night," she answered, and passed out.</p>

<p>They went down the stairs in silence, and reached the fernery;
then he stopped short.</p>

<p>"Will you not wait a moment here?" he said.</p>

<p>Stella shook her head.</p>

<p>"It must be late," she said.</p>

<p>"A moment only," he said. "Let me feel that I have you to
myself for a moment before you go&mdash;you have belonged to others
until now."</p>

<p>"No, no," she said&mdash;"I must go."</p>

<p>And she moved on; but he put out his hand, and stopped
her.</p>

<p>"Stella!"</p>

<p>She turned, and looked at him most piteously; but he saw
only her loveliness before him like a flower.</p>

<p>"Stella," he repeated, and he drew her nearer, "I must speak&mdash;I
must tell you&mdash;I love you!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">"I love you</span>," he said.</p>

<p>Only three words, but only a woman can understand what
those three words meant to Stella.</p>

<p>She was a girl&mdash;a mere child, as Lady Wyndward had said;
never, save from her father's lips, had she heard those words
before.</p>

<p>Even now she scarcely realized their full meaning. She only
knew that his hand was upon her arm; that his eyes were fixed
on hers with a passionate, pleading entreaty, combined with a
masterful power which she felt unable to resist.</p>

<p>White and almost breathless she stood, not downcast, for her
eyes felt drawn to his, all her maidenly nature roused and excited
by this first declaration of a man's love.</p>

<p>"Stella, I love you!" he repeated, and his voice sounded like
some low, subtle music, which rang through her ears even after
the words had died from his lips.</p>

<p>Pale and trembling she looked at him, and put her hand to
gently force his grasp from her arm.</p>

<p>"No, no!" she panted.</p>

<p>"But it is 'yes,'" he said, and he took her other hand and
held her a close prisoner, looking into the depths of the dark,
wondering, troubled eyes. "I love you, Stella."</p>

<p>"No," she repeated again, almost inaudibly. "It is impossible!"</p>

<p>"Impossible!" he echoed, and a faint smile flitted across the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
eager face&mdash;a smile that seemed to intensify the passion in his
eyes. "It seems to me impossible not to love you. Stella, are
you angry with me&mdash;offended? I have been too sudden, too
rude and rough."</p>

<p>At his tender pleading her eyes drooped for the first time.</p>

<p>Too rough, too rude! He, who seemed to her the type of
knightly chivalry and courtesy.</p>

<p>"I should have remembered how pure and delicate a flower
my beautiful love was," he murmured. "I should have remembered
that my love was a star, to be approached with reverence
and awe, not taken by storm. I have been too presumptuous;
but, oh, Stella, you do not know what such love as mine is! It
is like a mountain torrent hard to stem; it sweeps all before it.
That is my love for you, Stella. And now, what will you say to
me?"</p>

<p>As he spoke he drew her still nearer to him; she could feel
his breath stirring her hair, could almost hear the passionate
beating of his heart.</p>

<p>What should she say to him? If she allowed her heart to
speak she would hide her face upon his breast and whisper&mdash;"Take
me." But, girl as she was, she had some idea of all that
divided them; the very place in which they stood was eloquent
of the difference between them; between him, the future lord
of Wyndward, and she, the poor painter's niece.</p>

<p>"Will you not speak to me?" he murmured. "Have you not
a single word for me? Stella, if you knew how I long to hear
those beautiful lips answer me with the words I have spoken.
Stella, I would give all I possess in the world to hear you say,
'I love you!'"</p>

<p>"No, no," she said, again, almost pantingly. "Do not ask
me&mdash;do not say any more. I&mdash;I cannot bear it!"</p>

<p>His face flushed hotly for a moment, but he held her tightly,
and his eyes searched hers for the truth.</p>

<p>"Does it pain you to hear that I love you?" he whispered.
"Are you angry, sorry? Can you not love me, Stella? Oh, my
darling!&mdash;let me call you my darling, mine, if only for once,
for one short minute! See, you are mine, I hold you in both
hands! Be mine for a short minute at least, while you answer
me. Are you sorry? Can you not give me a little love in return
for all the love I bear you? Cannot you, Stella?"</p>

<p>Panting now, and with the rich color coming and going on
her face, she looks this way and that like some wild, timid animal
seeking to escape.</p>

<p>"Do not press me, do not force me to speak," she almost
moans. "Let me go now."</p>

<p>"No, by Heaven!" he says, almost fiercely. "You shall not,
must not go, until you have answered me. Tell me, Stella, is it
because I am nothing to you, and you do not like to tell me so?
Ah! better the truth at once, hard as it may be to bear, than
suspense. Tell me, Stella."</p>

<p>"It&mdash;it&mdash;is not that," she says, with drooping head.</p>

<p>"What is it, then?" he whispers, and he bends his head to catch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
her faintly whispered words, so that his lips almost touch her
face.</p>

<p>From the drawing-room comes the sound of some one playing;
it recalls all the grandeur of the scene, all the high mightiness of
the house to which he belongs&mdash;of which he is so nearly the
head, and it gives her strength.</p>

<p>Slowly she raises her head and looks at him.</p>

<p>There is infinite tenderness, infinite yearning, and suppressed
maidenly passion in her eyes.</p>

<p>"It is not that," she says. "But&mdash;do you forget?"</p>

<p>"Forget!" he asks, patiently, gently, though his eyes are burning
with impetuous eagerness.</p>

<p>"Do you forget who I am&mdash;who you are?" she says, faintly.</p>

<p>"I forget everything except that you are to me the most lovely
and precious of creatures on God's earth," he says, passionately.
Then, with a touch of his characteristic pride, "What
need have I to remember anything else, Stella?"</p>

<p>"But I have," she said. "Oh yes, it is for me to remember.
I cannot&mdash;I ought not to forget. It is for me to remember. I
am only Stella Etheridge, an artist's niece, a nobody&mdash;an insignificant
girl, and you&mdash;oh, Lord Leycester!"</p>

<p>"And I?" he says, as if ready to meet her fairly at every
point.</p>

<p>"And you!"&mdash;she looks around&mdash;"you are a nobleman; will
be the lord of all this beautiful place&mdash;of all that you were showing
me the other day. You should not, ought not to tell me that&mdash;that&mdash;what
you have told me."</p>

<p>He bent over her, and his hand closed on her arm with a masterful
caressing touch.</p>

<p>"You mean that because I am what I am&mdash;that because I am
rich I am to be made poor; because I have so much&mdash;too much,
that the one thing on earth which would make the rest worth
having is to be denied me."</p>

<p>He laughed almost fiercely.</p>

<p>"Better to be the poorest son of the soil than lord of many
acres, if that were true, Stella. But it is not. I do not care
whether I am rich or poor, noble or nameless&mdash;yes, I do! I am
glad for your sake. I have never cared before. I have never
realized it before, but I do now. I am glad now. Do you know
why?"</p>

<p>She shook her head, her eyes downcast.</p>

<p>"Because I can lay them all at your feet," and as he speaks he
bends on one knee beside her and draws her hand with trembling
hands to his heart.</p>

<p>"See, Stella, I lay them at your feet. I say take them, if you
think them worth&mdash;take them, and make them worth having;
no, I say rather, share them with me? Set against your love, my
darling, title, lands, wealth&mdash;are all worthless dross to me. Give
me your love, Stella; I must, I will have it!" and he presses
a passionate clinging kiss on her hand.</p>

<p>Frightened by his vehemence, Stella draws her hand away and
shrinks back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>He rises and draws her to a seat, standing beside her calm and
penitent.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Stella! I frighten you! See, I will be quite
gentle and quiet&mdash;only listen to me!"</p>

<p>"No, no," she murmurs, trembling, "I must not. Think&mdash;if&mdash;if&mdash;I
said what you wish me to say, how could I meet the
countess? What would they say to me? They would blame
me for stealing your love."</p>

<p>"You have not stolen; no nun from a convent could have been
more free from artifice than you, Stella. You have stolen
nothing; it is I who have <i>given</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">GIVEN</span> you all."</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"It is the same," she murmured. "They would be so displeased.
Oh, it cannot be."</p>

<p>"It cannot be?" he repeated, with a smile. "But it has
already come to pass. Am I one to love and unlove in a breath,
Stella? Look at me!"</p>

<p>She raises her eyes, and meets his eager, passionate gaze.</p>

<p>"Do I look like one to be swayed as a reed by any passing
wind, gentle or rough? No, Stella, such love as I feel for you
is not to be turned aside. Even if you were to tell me that you
do not, cannot love me, my love would not die; it has taken root
in my heart&mdash;it has become part of myself. There is not one
hour since I saw you that I have not thought about you. Stella,
you have come to me even in my sleep; I have dreamed that you
whispered to me, 'I love you.' Let the dream be a true one.
Oh, my life, my darling, let your heart speak, if it is to say that
it loves me. See, Stella, you are all the world to me&mdash;do not rob
me of happiness. You do not doubt my love?"</p>

<p>Doubt his love! That was not possible for her to do, since
every word, every look, bore the impress of truth.</p>

<p>But still she would not yield. Even as he spoke, she fancied
she could see the stern face of the earl looking at her with hard
condemnation&mdash;could see the beautiful eyes of the countess looking
down at her with cold displeasure and wondering, amazed
scorn.</p>

<p>Footsteps were approaching, and she rose hurriedly, to fly
from him if need be. But Lord Leycester was not a man to be
turned aside. As she rose he took her arm gently, tenderly,
with loving persuasion, and drew her near to him.</p>

<p>"Come with me," he said. "Do not leave me for a moment.
See, the door is open&mdash;it is quite warm. We shall be alone here.
Oh, my darling, do not leave me in suspense."</p>

<p>She was powerless to resist, and he led her on to the terrace
outside.</p>

<p>Out into the dusky night, odorous with the breath of the
flowers, and mystical in the dim light of the stars. A gentle
summer, zephyr-like air stirred the trees; the sound of the
water falling over the weir came like music up the hillside. A
nightingale sang in the woods below them; all the night
seemed full of slumberous passion and unspoken love.</p>

<p>"We are alone here, Stella," he murmured. "Now answer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
me. Listen once more, darling! I am not tired of telling you;
I shall never tire of it. Listen! I love you&mdash;I love you!"</p>

<p>The stars grew dull and misty before her eyes, the charm of
his voice, of his presence, was stealing over her; the passionate
love which burnt in her heart for him was finding its way
through cool prudence, her lips were tremulous. A sigh, long
and deep, broke from them.</p>

<p>"I love you!" he replied, as if the words were a spell, as indeed
they were&mdash;a spell not to be resisted. "Give me your answer,
Stella. Come close to me. Whisper it! whisper 'I love
you,' or send me away. But you will not do that; no, you shall
not do that!" and forgetful of his vow to be gentle with her, he
put his arm round her, drew her to him and&mdash;kissed her.</p>

<p>It was the first kiss. A thrill ran through her, the sky seemed
to sink, the whole night to pause as if it were waiting. With a
little shudder of exquisite pleasure, mingled with that subtle
pain which ecstasy always brings in its train, she laid her head
upon his breast, and hiding her eyes, murmured&mdash;</p>

<p>"I love you!"</p>

<p>If the words meant much to him&mdash;to him the man of the
world before whom many a beautiful woman had been ready to
bow with complaisant homage&mdash;if they meant much to him,
how much more did they mean to her?</p>

<p>All her young maiden faith spoke in those three words. With
them she surrendered her young, pure life, her unstained, unsullied
heart to him. With a passion as intense as his own, she
repaid him tenfold. For a moment he was silent, his eyes fixed
on the stars, his whole being thrilling under the music&mdash;the joy
of this simple avowal. Then he pressed her to him, and poured
a shower of kisses upon her hair and upon her arm which lay
across his breast.</p>

<p>"My darling, my darling!" he murmured. "Is it really true?
Can I&mdash;dare I believe it: you love me? Oh, my darling, the
whole world seems changed to me. You love me! See, Stella,
it seems so wonderful that I cannot realize it. Let me see your
eyes, I shall find the truth there."</p>

<p>She pressed still closer to him, but he raised her head gently&mdash;in
his very touch was a caress, and it was as if his hands kissed
her&mdash;and looked long into the rapt, upturned eyes. Then he
bent his head slowly, and kissed her once&mdash;hungrily, clingingly.</p>

<p>Stella's eyes closed and her face paled under that passionate
caress, then slowly and with a little sigh she raised her head
and kissed him back again, kiss for kiss.</p>

<p>No word was spoken; side by side, with her head upon his
breast, they stood in silence. For them Time had vanished, the
whole world seemed to stand still.</p>

<p>Half amazed, with a dim wonder at this new delight which
had entered her life, Stella watched the stars and listened to the
music of the river. Something had happened to change her
whole existence, it was as if the old Stella whom she knew so
well had gone, and a new being, wonderfully blessed, wonderfully
happy, had taken her place.</p>

<p>And as for him, for the man of the world, he too stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
amazed, overwhelmed by the new-born joy. If any one had told
him that life held such a moment for him, he would not have
believed it; he who had, as he thought, drained the cup of
earthly pleasure to the dregs. His blood ran wildly through
his veins, his heart beat madly.</p>

<p>"At last," he murmured; "this is love."</p>

<p>But suddenly the awakening came. With a start she looked
up at him and strove to free herself, vainly, from his embrace.</p>

<p>"What have I done?" she whispered, with awe-subdued voice.</p>

<p>"Done!" he murmured, with a rapt smile. "Made one man
happier than he ever dreamed it possible for mortal to be. That
is all."</p>

<p>"Ah, no!" she said; "I have done wrong! I am afraid!&mdash;afraid!"</p>

<p>"Afraid of what? There is nothing to make you afraid. Can
you speak of fear while you are in my arms&mdash;with your head on
my breast? Lean back, my darling; now speak of fear."</p>

<p>"Yes, even now," she whispered. "Now&mdash;and I am so happy!"
she broke off to herself, but he heard her. "So happy! Is it all
a dream? Tell me."</p>

<p>He bent and kissed her.</p>

<p>"Is it a dream, do you think?" he answered.</p>

<p>The crimson dyed her face and neck, and her eyes drooped.</p>

<p>"And you are happy?" he said. "Think what I must be. For
a man's love is deeper, more passionate than a woman's, Stella.
Think what I must be!"</p>

<p>She sighed and looked up at him.</p>

<p>"But still it is wrong! I fear that. All the world will say
that."</p>

<p>"All the world!" he echoed, with smiling scorn. "What have
we to do with the world? We two stand outside, beyond it.
Our world is love&mdash;is our two selves, my darling."</p>

<p>"All the world," she said. "Ah! what will they say?" and instinctively
she glanced over her shoulder at the great house with
the glow of light streaming from its many windows. "Even
now&mdash;now they are wondering where you are, expecting, waiting
for you. What would they say if they knew you were here
with me&mdash;and&mdash;and all that has happened?"</p>

<p>His eyes darkened. He knew better than she, with all her
fears, what they would say, and already he was braving himself
to meet the storm, but he smiled to re-assure her.</p>

<p>"They will say that I am the most fortunate of men. They
will say that the gods have lavished their good gifts with both
hands&mdash;they have given me all the things that you make so much
of, and the greatest of all things&mdash;the true sole love of a pure,
beautiful angel."</p>

<p>"Oh, hush, hush!" she murmured.</p>

<p>"You are an angel to me," he said, simply. "I am not
worthy to touch the hem of your dress! If I could but live my
worthless, sinful life over again, for your sake, my darling,
it should be purer and a little less unworthy of you."</p>

<p>"Oh, hush!" she murmured. "You unworthy of me! You
are my king!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>Strong man as he was he was stirred and moved to the
depths of his being at the simple words, eloquent of her absolute
trust and devotion.</p>

<p>"My Stella," he murmured, "if you knew all; but see, my
life is yours from henceforth. I place it in your hands, mold
it as you will. It is yours henceforth."</p>

<p>She was looking at him, all her soul in her eyes, and at his
words of passionate protestation, a sudden thrill ran through
her, then as instantly, as if a sudden cold hand had come between
them, she shivered.</p>

<p>"Mine," she breathed, fearfully, "until they snatch it from
me."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">He</span> started. The words had almost the solemnity of a prophesy.</p>

<p>"Who will dare?" he said; then he laughed. "My little, fearsome,
trembling darling!" he murmured, "fear nothing or
rather, tell me what you fear, and whom."</p>

<p>She glanced toward the windows.</p>

<p>"I fear them all!" she said, quietly and simply.</p>

<p>"My father?"</p>

<p>She inclined her head and let her head fall upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>"The countess, all of them. Lord Leycester&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He put his hand upon her lips softly.</p>

<p>"What was that I heard?" he said, with tender reproach.</p>

<p>She looked up.</p>

<p>"Leycester," she whispered.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"Would to Heaven the name stood alone," he said, almost
bitterly. "The barrier you fancy stands between us would vanish
and fade away then. Never, even in sport, call me by my
title again, my darling, or I shall hate it!"</p>

<p>She smiled.</p>

<p>"I shall never forget it," she said. "They will not let me.
I am not Lady Lenore."</p>

<p>He started slightly, then looked down at her.</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven, no!" he said, with a smile.</p>

<p>Stella smiled almost sadly.</p>

<p>"She might forget; she is noble too. How beautiful she is!"</p>

<p>"Is she?" he said, smiling down at her. "To me there is
only one beautiful face in the world, and&mdash;it is here," and he
touched it with his finger&mdash;"here&mdash;my very own. But what is
Lenore to us to-night, my darling? Why do you speak of her?"</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;shall I tell you?"</p>

<p>He nodded, looking down at her.</p>

<p>"Because they said&mdash;Lady Lilian said, that&mdash;&mdash;" she stopped.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"That they wished you to marry her," she whispered.</p>

<p>He laughed, his short laugh.</p>

<p>"She might say the same of several young ladies," he said.
"My mother is very anxious on the point. Yes, but wishes are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
not horses, or one could probably be persuaded to mount and
ride as their parents wish them&mdash;don't that sound wise and profound?
I shall not ride to Lady Lenore; I have ridden to your
feet, my darling!"</p>

<p>"And you will never ride away again," she murmured.</p>

<p>"Never," he said. "Here, by your side, I shall remain while
life lasts!"</p>

<p>"While life lasts!" she repeated, as if the words were music.
"I shall have you near me always. Ah, it sounds too beautiful!
too beautiful!"</p>

<p>"But it will be true," he said.</p>

<p>The clock chimed the hour. Stella started.</p>

<p>"So late!" she said, with a little sigh. "I must go!" and she
glanced at the windows with a little shudder. "If I could but
steal away without seeing them&mdash;without being seen! I feel&mdash;" she
paused, and the crimson covered her face and neck&mdash;"as if
they had but to glance at me to know&mdash;to know what has happened,"
and she trembled.</p>

<p>"Are you so afraid?" he said. "Really so afraid? Well,
why should they know?"</p>

<p>She looked up eagerly.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, do not let them know! Why should we tell them;
it&mdash;it is like letting them share in our happiness; it is our secret,
is it not?"</p>

<p>"Let us keep it," he said, quietly, musingly. "Why should
they know, indeed! Let us keep the world outside, for a while
at least. You and I alone in our love, my darling."</p>

<p>With his arm round her they went back to the fernery, and
here she drew away from him, but not until he had taken another
kiss.</p>

<p>"It is our real 'good night,' you know," he said; "the 'good-night'
we shall say presently will mean nothing. This is our
'good-night.' Happy dreams, my angel, my star!"</p>

<p>Stella clung to him for a moment with a little reluctant sigh,
then she looked up at him with a smile.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I am awfully tumbled and tangled," she said,
putting her hand to her hair.</p>

<p>He smoothed the silken threads with his hand, and as he did
so drew the rose from her hair.</p>

<p>"This is mine," he murmured, and he put it in his coat.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" she exclaimed. "And this is how you keep our
secret! Do you not think every eye would notice that great
rose, and know whence it came?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I see," he said. "After all, a woman is the one for
a secret&mdash;the man is not in the field; but then it will be safe
here," and he put the rose inside the breast of his coat.</p>

<p>Then trying to look as if nothing had happened, trying to look
as if the whole world had not become changed for her, Stella
sauntered into the drawing-room by his side.</p>

<p>And it really seemed as if no one had noticed their entrance.
Stella felt inclined to congratulate herself, not taking into consideration
the usages of high breeding, which enable so many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
people to look as if they were unaware of an entrance which
they had been expecting for an hour since.</p>

<p>"No one seems to notice," she whispered behind her fan, but
Lord Leycester smiled&mdash;he knew better.</p>

<p>She walked up the room, and Lord Leycester stopped before a
picture and pointed to it; but he did not speak of the picture&mdash;instead,
he murmured:</p>

<p>"Will you meet me by the stile by the river to-morrow
evening, Stella?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she murmured.</p>

<p>"I will bring the boat, and we will row down the stream.
Will you come at six o'clock?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said again.</p>

<p>If he asked her to meet him on the banks of the Styx, she
would have answered as obediently.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Etheridge approached with the countess, and before
he could speak Lord Leycester took the bull by the horns, as it
were.</p>

<p>"Lilian is delighted with the sketch," he said. "We left her
filled with gratitude, did we not Miss Etheridge?"</p>

<p>Stella inclined her head. The large, serene eyes of the countess
seemed to penetrate to the bottom of her heart and read
her&mdash;their&mdash;secret already.</p>

<p>"I think we must be going, Stella; the fly has been waiting
some time," said her uncle in his quiet fashion.</p>

<p>"So soon!" murmured the countess.</p>

<p>But Mr. Etheridge glanced at the clock with a smile, and Stella
held out her hand.</p>

<p>As she did so, she felt rather than saw the graceful form of
Lady Lenore coming toward them.</p>

<p>"Are you going, Miss Etheridge?" she said, her clear voice full
of regret. "We have seen so little of you; and I meant to ask
you so much about Italy. I am so sorry."</p>

<p>And as she spoke, she looked full into poor Stella's eyes.</p>

<p>For a moment Stella was silent and downcast, then she raised
her eyes and held out her hand.</p>

<p>"It is late," she murmured. "Yes, we must go."</p>

<p>As she looked up, she met the gaze of the violet eyes, and almost
started, for there seemed to be shining in them a significant
smile of mocking scorn and contemptuous amusement; they
seemed to say, quite plainly:</p>

<p>"You think that no one knows your secret. You think that
you have triumphed, that you have won him. Poor simple child,
poor fool. Wait and see!"</p>

<p>If ever eyes spoke, this is what Lady Lenore's seemed to say
in that momentary glance, and as Stella turned aside, her face
paled slightly.</p>

<p>"You must come and see us again, Miss Etheridge," said the
countess, graciously.</p>

<p>"Lilian has extorted a solemn promise to that effect," said
Leycester, as he shook hands with Mr. Etheridge.</p>

<p>Then he held out his hand to Stella, but in spite of prudence
he could not part from her till the last moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let me take you to your carriage," he said, "and see that
you are well wrapped up."</p>

<p>The countess's eyes grew cold, and she looked beyond them
rather than at them, and Stella murmured something about
trouble, but he laughed softly, and drawing her hand on his
arm led her away.</p>

<p>All the room saw it, and a sort of thrill ran through them; it
was an attention he paid only to such old and honored friends as
the old countess and Lenore.</p>

<p>"Oh, why did you come?" whispered Stella, as they reached
the hall. "The countess looked so angry."</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>"I could not help it. There, not a word more. Now let me
wrap this round you;" and, of course, as he wrapped it round
her, he managed to convey a caress in the touch of his hand.</p>

<p>"Remember, my darling," he murmured, almost dangerously
loud, as he put her into the fly. "To-morrow at six."</p>

<p>Then he stood bareheaded, and the last Stella saw was the
light of tender, passionate love burning in his dark eyes.</p>

<p>She sank back in the furthermost corner of the fly in silent,
rapt reflection. Was it all a dream? Was it only a trick of
fancy, or did she feel his passionate kisses on her lips and face
entangled in her hair. Had she really heard Lord Leycester
Wyndward declare that he loved her?</p>

<p>"Are you asleep, Stella?" said her uncle, and she started.</p>

<p>"No, not asleep, dear," she said. "But&mdash;but tired and so
happy!" The word slipped out before she was aware of it.</p>

<p>But the unsuspecting recluse did not notice the thrill of joy
in the tone of her reply.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, just so, I daresay. It was something new and
strange to you. It is a beautiful place. By the way, what do
you think of Lady Lenore?"</p>

<p>Stella started.</p>

<p>"Oh, she is very beautiful, and as wonderful as you said,
dear," she murmured.</p>

<p>"Yes, isn't she. She will make a grand countess, will she
not?"</p>

<p>"What!" said Stella.</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>"Wonderful creatures women are, to be sure. For the life of
me I could not tell in exact words how the countess managed to
give me the impression, but she did give it me, and unmistakably."</p>

<p>"What impression!" said Stella.</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>"That matters were settled between Lord Leycester and Lady
Lenore, and that they were to be married. They will make a
fine match, will they not?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;no&mdash;I mean yes," said Stella, and a happy smile came
into her eyes as she leant back.</p>

<p>No, it was not Lady Lenore he was going to marry&mdash;not the
great beauty with the golden hair and violet eyes, but a little
mere nobody, called Stella Etheridge. She leant back and hugged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
her secret to her bosom and caressed it. The fly trundled
along after the manner of flys, and stopped at last at the white
gate in the lane.</p>

<p>Mr. Etheridge got out and held his hand for Stella, and she
leapt out. As she did so, she uttered a slight cry, for a tall figure
was standing beside the gate in the light by the lamps.</p>

<p>"Bless my soul, what's the matter?" exclaimed Mr. Etheridge,
turning round. "Oh, it's you, Mr. Adelstone."</p>

<p>"I am very sorry to have startled you, Miss Stella," said Jasper
Adelstone, and he came forward with his hat raised by his
left hand; his right was in a sling. Stella's gentle eyes saw it,
and her face paled.</p>

<p>"I was taking a stroll through the meadows and looked in.
Mrs. Penfold said that you had gone to the Hall. Coming back
from the river I heard the fly, and waited to say 'good-night.'"</p>

<p>"It is very kind," murmured Stella, her eyes still fixed on the
useless arm with a kind of fascination.</p>

<p>"Come in and have a cigar," said Mr. Etheridge. "Ah! what
is the matter with your arm, man?"</p>

<p>Jasper looked at him, then turned his small keen eyes on Stella's
face.</p>

<p>"A mere trifle," he said. "I&mdash;met with an accident the other
day and sprained it. It is a mere nothing. No, I won't come
in, thanks. By-the-way, I'm nearly forgetting a most important
matter," and he put his left hand in his pocket and drew something
out. "I met the post-office boy in the lane, and he gave
me this to save his legs," and he held out a telegram envelope.</p>

<p>"A telegram for me!" exclaimed Mr. Etheridge. "Wonders
will never cease. Come inside, Mr. Adelstone."</p>

<p>But Jasper shook his head.</p>

<p>"I will wish you good-night, now," he said. "Will you excuse
my left hand, Miss Stella?" he added, as he extended it.</p>

<p>Stella took it; it was burning, hot, and dry.</p>

<p>"I am so sorry," she said, in a low voice. "I cannot tell how
sorry I am!"</p>

<p>"Do not think of it," he said. "Pray forget it, as&mdash;I do," he
added, with hidden irony. "It is a mere nothing."</p>

<p>Stella looked down.</p>

<p>"And I am sure that&mdash;Lord Leycester is sorry."</p>

<p>"No doubt," he said. "I am quite sure Lord Leycester did
not want to break my arm. But, indeed, I was rightly punished
for my carelessness, though, I assure you, that I should have
pulled up in time."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; I am sure of that. I am sure I was in no danger,"
said Stella, earnestly.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, in a low voice. "There was really no necessity
for Lord Leycester to throw me off my horse, or even to insult
me. But Lord Leycester is a privileged person, is he not?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know what you mean!" said Stella, faintly.</p>

<p>"I mean that Lord Leycester may do things with impunity
which others cannot even think of," and his sharp eyes grew to
her face, which Stella felt was growing crimson.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I am sure he will be very sorry," she said, "when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
knows how much you are hurt, and he will apologize most
sincerely."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt," he said, lightly, "and, after all, it is
something to have one's arm sprained by Lord Leycester
Wyndward, is it not? It is better than a broken heart."</p>

<p>"A broken heart! What do you mean?" said Stella, her face
flushed, her eyes challenging his with a touch of indignation.</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>"I meant that Lord Leycester is as skilled in breaking hearts
as limbs. But I forgot I must not say anything against the heir
to Wyndward in your hearing. Pray forgive me. Good-night."</p>

<p>And, with a bow and a keen look from his small eyes, he
moved away.</p>

<p>Stella stood looking after him for a moment, and a shiver ran
through her as if from a cold wind.</p>

<p>Breaking hearts! What did he mean?</p>

<p>An exclamation from her uncle caused her to turn suddenly.</p>

<p>He was standing in the light of the window, with the open
telegram in his hand, his face pale and anxious.</p>

<p>"Great Heaven!" he muttered, "what am I to do?"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">"What</span> shall I do?" exclaimed Mr. Etheridge.</p>

<p>Stella came to him quickly, with a little cry of dismay.</p>

<p>"What is it, uncle? Are you ill&mdash;is it bad news? Oh, what
is the matter?"</p>

<p>And she looked up into his pale and agitated face with anxious
concern.</p>

<p>His gaze was fixed on vacancy, but there was more than abstraction
in his eyes&mdash;there was acute pain and anguish.</p>

<p>"What is it, dear?" she asked, laying her hand on his arm.
"Pray tell me."</p>

<p>At the words he started slightly, and crushed the telegram in
his hand.</p>

<p>"No, no!" he said&mdash;"anything but that." Then, composing
himself with an effort, he pressed her hand and smiled faintly.
"Yes, it is bad news, Stella; it is always bad news that a telegram
brings."</p>

<p>Stella led him in; his hands were trembling, and the dumb
look of pain still clouded his eyes.</p>

<p>"Will you not tell me what it is?" she murmured, as he sank
into his accustomed chair and leant his white head on his hand.
"Tell me what it is, and let me help you to bear it by sharing it
with you."</p>

<p>And she wound her arm around his neck.</p>

<p>"Don't ask me, Stella. I can't tell you&mdash;I cannot. The shame
would kill me. No! No!"</p>

<p>"Shame!" murmured Stella, her proud, lovely face paling, as
she shrank back a little; but the next moment she pressed closer
to him, with a sad smile.</p>

<p>"Not shame for you, dear; shame and you were never meant
to come together."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>He started, and raised his head.</p>

<p>"Yes, shame!" he repeated, almost fiercely, his hands
clinched&mdash;"such bitter, debasing shame and disgrace. For the
first time the name we have held for so many years will be
stained and dragged in the dirt. What shall I do?" And he
hid his face in his hands.</p>

<p>Then, with a sudden start, he rose, and looked round with
trembling eagerness.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I must go to London," he said, brokenly. "What is the
time? So late! Is there no train? Stella, run and ask Mrs.
Penfold. I must go at once&mdash;at once; every moment is of consequence."</p>

<p>"Go to London&mdash;to-night&mdash;so late? Oh, you cannot!" exclaimed
Stella, aghast.</p>

<p>"My dear, I must," he said more calmly. "It is urgent,
most urgent business that calls for me, and I must go."</p>

<p>Stella stole out of the room, and was about to wake Mrs. Penfold,
when she remembered having seen a time-table in the
kitchen, and stealing down-stairs again, hunted until she found
it.</p>

<p>When she took it into the studio, she found her uncle standing
with his hat on and his coat buttoned.</p>

<p>"Give it to me," he said. "There is a train, an early market
train that I can catch if I start at once," and with trembling
fingers he turned over the pages of the time-book. "Yes, I
must go, Stella."</p>

<p>"But not alone, uncle!" she implored. "Not alone, surely.
You will let me come with you."</p>

<p>He put his hand upon her arm and kissed her, his eyes moist.</p>

<p>"Stella, I must go alone; no one can help me in this matter.
There are some troubles that we must meet unaided except by a
Higher Power; this is one of them. Heaven bless you, my dear;
you help me to bear it with your loving sympathy. I wish I
could tell you, but I cannot, Stella&mdash;I cannot."</p>

<p>"Do not then, dear," she whispered. "You will not be away
long?"</p>

<p>"Not longer than I can help," he sighed. "You will be quite
safe, Stella?"</p>

<p>"Safe!" and she smiled sadly.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Penfold must take care of you. I don't like leaving
you, but it cannot be helped! Child, I did not think to have a
secret from you so soon!"</p>

<p>At the words Stella started, and a red flush came over her
face.</p>

<p>She, too, had a secret, and as it flashed into her mind, from
whence the sudden trouble had momentarily banished it, her
heart beat fast and her eyes drooped.</p>

<p>"There should be no secrets between us two," he said. "But&mdash;there&mdash;there&mdash;don't
look so troubled, my dear. I shall not be
long gone."</p>

<p>She clung to him to the last, until indeed the little white gate
had closed behind him, then she went back to the house and sat
down in his chair, and sat pondering and trembling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>For a time the secret trouble which had befallen her uncle absorbed
all her mind and care, but presently the memory of all
that had happened to her that evening awoke and overcame her
sorrow, and she sat with clasped hands and drooping head recalling
the handsome face and passionate voice of Lord Leycester.</p>

<p>It was all so wonderful, so unreal, that it seemed like a stage
play, in which the magnificent house formed the scene and the
noble men and women the players, with the tall, stalwart, graceful
form of Lord Leycester for the hero. It was difficult to
realize that she too took a part, so to speak, in the drama, that
she was, in fact, the heroine, and that it was to her that all the
passionate vows of the young lord had been spoken. She could
feel his burning kisses on her lips; could feel the touch of the
clinging, lingering caresses on her neck; yes, it was all real; she
loved Lord Leycester, and he, strange and wonderful to add,
loved her.</p>

<p>Why should he do it? she marveled. Who was she that he
should deign to shower down upon her such fervent admiration
and passionate devotion?</p>

<p>Mechanically she rose and went over to the Venetian mirror,
and looked at the reflection which beamed softly in the dim
light.</p>

<p>He had called her beautiful, lovely! She shook her head and
smiled with a sigh as she thought of Lady Lenore. There were
beauty and loveliness indeed! How had it happened that he had
passed her by, and chosen her, Stella?</p>

<p>But it was so, and wonder, and gratitude and love welled up
in her heart and filled her eyes with those tears which show that
the cup of human happiness is full to overflowing. The clock
struck the hour, and with a sigh, as she thought of her uncle,
she turned from the glass. She felt that she could not go to
bed; it was far pleasanter to sit up in the stillness and silence
and think&mdash;think! To take one little incident after another,
and go over it slowly and enjoyingly. She wandered about her
room in this frame of mind, filled with happiness one moment
as she thought of the great good which the gods had given unto
her, then overwhelmed by a wave of troubled anxiety as she remembered
that her uncle, the old man whose goodness to her
had won her love, was speeding on the journey toward his secret
trouble and sorrow.</p>

<p>Wandering thus she suddenly bethought her of a picture that
stood with its face to the wall, and swooping down on it, as one
does on a suddenly remembered treasure, she took up Leycester
Wyndward's portrait, and gazing long and eagerly at it, suddenly
bent and kissed it. She knew now what the smile in those
dark eyes meant; she knew now how the lovelight could flash
from them.</p>

<p>"Uncle was right," she murmured with a smile that was half
sad. "There is no woman who could resist those eyes if they
said 'I love you.'"</p>

<p>She put the portrait down upon the cabinet, so that she could
see it when she chose to look at it, and abstractedly began to set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the room in order, putting a picture straight here and setting
the books upon their shelves, stopping occasionally to glance at
the handsome eyes watching her from the top of the cabinet.
As often happens when the mind is set on one thing and the
hands upon another, she met with an accident. In one corner
of the room stood a three-cornered what-not of Japanese work,
inclosed by doors inlaid with ivory and mother-of-pearl; in attempting
to set a bronze straight upon the top of this piece of
furniture while she looked at the portrait of her heart's lord and
master, she let the bronze slip, and in the endeavor to save it
from falling, overturned the what-not.</p>

<p>It fell with the usual brittle sounding crash which accompanies
the overthrow of such bric-a-brac, and the doors being
forced open, out poured a miscellaneous collection of valuable
but useless articles.</p>

<p>With a little exclamation of self-reproach and dismay, Stella
went down on her knees to collect the scattered curios. They
were of all sorts; bits of old china from Japan, medals, and
coins of ancient date, and some miniatures in carved frames.</p>

<p>Stella eyed each article as she picked it up with anxious criticism,
but fortunately nothing appeared the worse for the downfall,
and she was putting the last thing, a miniature, in its
accustomed place, when the case flew open in her hand and a delicately
painted portrait on ivory looked up at her. Scarcely glancing
at it, she was about to replace it in the case, when an inscription
on the back caught her eye, and she carried case and
miniature to the light.</p>

<p>The portrait was that of a boy, a fair-haired boy, with a smiling
mouth and laughing blue eyes. It was a pretty face, and
Stella turned it over to read the inscription.</p>

<p>It consisted of only one word, "Frank."</p>

<p>Stella looked at the face again listlessly, but suddenly something
in it&mdash;a resemblance to someone whom she knew, and that
intimately&mdash;flashed upon her. She looked again more curiously.
Yes, there could be no doubt of it; the face bore a certain
likeness to that of her uncle. Not only to her uncle, but to herself,
for raising her eyes from the portrait to the mirror she saw
a vague something&mdash;in expression only perhaps&mdash;looking at her
from the glass as it did from the portrait.</p>

<p>"Frank, Frank," she murmured; "I know no one of that name.
Who can it be?"</p>

<p>She went back to the cabinet, and took out the other miniatures,
but they were closed, and the spring which she had
touched accidentally of the one of the boy she could not find in
the others.</p>

<p>There was an air of mystery about the matter, which not a
little heightened by the lateness of the hour and the solemn silence
that reigned in the house, oppressed and haunted her.</p>

<p>With a little gesture of repudiation she put the boy's face into
its covering, and replaced it in the cabinet. As she did so she
glanced up at that other face smiling down at her, and started,
and a sudden thought, half-weird, half-prophetical, flashed across
her mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the portrait of Lord Leycester which had greeted her
on the night of her arrival, and foreshadowed all that had
happened to her. Was there anything of significance in this
chance discovery of the child's face?</p>

<p>With a smile of self-reproach she put the fantastic idea from
her, and setting the beloved face in its place amongst the other
canvases, took the candle from the table, and stole quietly up-stairs.</p>

<p>But when she slept the boy's face haunted her, and mingled
in her dreams with that of Lord Leycester's.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Lord Leycester</span> stood for a minute or two looking after the
carriage that bore Stella and her uncle away; then he returned
to the house. They were a hot-headed race, these Wyndwards,
and Leycester was, to put it mildly, as little capable of prudence
or calculation as any of his line; but though his heart was beating
fast, and the vision of the beautiful girl in all her young
unstained loveliness danced before his eyes as he crossed the
hall, even he paused a moment to consider the situation. With
a grim smile he felt forced to confess that it was rather a singular
one.</p>

<p>The heir of Wyndward, the hope of the house, the heir to an
ancient name and a princely estate, had plighted his troth to
the niece of a painter&mdash;a girl, be she beautiful as she might,
without either rank or wealth, to recommend her to his parents!</p>

<p>He might have chosen from the highest and the wealthiest;
the highest and the wealthiest had been, so to speak, at his feet.
He knew that no dearer wish existed in his mother's heart of
hearts than that he should marry and settle. Well, he was going
to marry and settle. But what a marriage and settlement it
would be! Instead of adding luster to the already illustrious
name, instead of adding power to the already influential race of
Wyndward, it would, in the earl and countess's eyes, in the opinion
of the world, be nothing but a mesalliance.</p>

<p>He paused in the corridor, the two footmen eying him with
covert and respectful attention, and a smile curved his lips as he
pictured to himself the manner in which the proud countess
would receive his avowal of love for Stella Etheridge, the painter's
niece.</p>

<p>Even as it was, he was quite conscious that he had gone very
far indeed this evening toward provoking the displeasure of the
countess. He had almost neglected the brilliant gathering for
the sake of this unknown girl; he had left his mother's oldest
friends, even Lady Lenore herself, to follow Stella. How would
they receive him?</p>

<p>With a smile half-defiant, half anticipatory of amusement, he
motioned to the servants to withdraw the curtain, and entered
the room.</p>

<p>Some of the ladies had already retired; Lady Longford had
gone for one, but Lady Lenore still sat on her couch attended by
a circle of devoted adherents. As he entered, the countess,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
without seeming to glance at him, saw him, and noticed the
peculiar expression on his face.</p>

<p>It was the expression which it always wore when he was on
the brink of some rashly mad exploit.</p>

<p>Leycester had plenty of courage&mdash;too much, some said. He
walked straight up to the countess, and stood over her.</p>

<p>"Well, mother," he said, almost as if he were challenging
her, "what do you think of her?"</p>

<p>The countess lifted her serene eyes and looked at him. She
would not pretend to be ignorant of whom he meant.</p>

<p>"Of Miss Etheridge?" she said. "I have not thought about
her. If I had, I should say that she was a very pleasant-looking
girl."</p>

<p>"Pleasant-looking!" he echoed, and his eyebrows went up.
"That is a mild way of describing her. She is more than
pleasant."</p>

<p>"That is enough for a young girl in her position," said the
countess.</p>

<p>"Or in any," said a musical voice behind him, and Lord Leycester,
turning round, saw Lady Lenore.</p>

<p>"That was well said," he said, nodding.</p>

<p>"She is more than pleasant," said Lady Lenore, smiling at
him as if he had won her warmest approbation by neglecting
her all the evening. "She is very pretty, beautiful, indeed, and
so&mdash;may I say the word, dear Lady Wyndward?&mdash;so fresh!"</p>

<p>The countess smiled with her even brows unclouded.</p>

<p>"A school-girl should be fresh, as you put it Lenore, or she is
nothing."</p>

<p>Lord Leycester looked from one to the other, and his gaze
rested on Lady Lenore's superb beauty with a complacent eye.</p>

<p>To say that a man in love is blind to all women other than the
one of his heart is absurd. It is not true. He had never admired
Lady Lenore more than he did this moment when she
spoke in Stella's defense; but he admired her while he loved
Stella.</p>

<p>"You are right, Lenore," he said. "She is beautiful."</p>

<p>"I admire her exceedingly," said Lady Lenore, smiling at him
as if she knew his secret and approved of it.</p>

<p>The countess glanced from one to the other.</p>

<p>"It is getting late," she said. "You must go now, Lenore."</p>

<p>Lady Lenore bowed her head. She, like all else who came
within the circle of the mistress of Wyndward, obeyed her.</p>

<p>"Very well, I am a little tired. Good-night!"</p>

<p>Lord Leycester took her hand, but held it a moment. He felt
grateful to her for the word spoken on Stella's behalf.</p>

<p>"Let me see you to the corridor," said Lord Leycester.</p>

<p>And with a bow which comprehended the other occupants of
the room, he accompanied her.</p>

<p>They walked in silence to the foot of the stairs, then Lady
Lenore held out her hand.</p>

<p>"Good-night," she said, "and happy dreams."</p>

<p>He looked at her curiously. Was there any significance in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
words?&mdash;did she know all that had passed between Stella and
himself?</p>

<p>But nothing more significant met his scrutiny than the soft
languor of her eyes, and pressing her hand as he bent over it, he
murmured:</p>

<p>"I wish you the same."</p>

<p>She nodded smilingly to him, and went away, and he turned
back to the hall.</p>

<p>As he did so the billiard-room door opened, and Lord Charles
put out his head.</p>

<p>"One game, Ley?" he said.</p>

<p>Lord Leycester shook his head.</p>

<p>"Not to-night, Charlie."</p>

<p>Lord Charles looked at him, then laughed, and withdrew his
head.</p>

<p>Leycester sauntered down the hall and back again; he felt
very restless and disinclined for bed; Stella's voice was ringing
in his ears, Stella's lips still clung with that last soft caress to
his. He could not face the laughter and hard voices of the billiard-room;
it would be profanation! With a sudden turn he
went lightly up the stairs and entered his own room.</p>

<p>Throwing himself into a chair, he folded his arms behind his
head and closed his eyes, to call up a vision of the girl who
had rested on his breast&mdash;whose sweet, pure lips had murmured
"I love you!"</p>

<p>"My darling!" he whispered&mdash;"my darling love! I have
never known it till now. And I shall see you to-morrow, and
hear you whisper that again, 'I love you!' And it's <span class="smcap">ME</span> she
loves, not the viscount and heir to Wyndward, but <i>me</i>, Leycester!
Leycester&mdash;it was a hard, ugly name until she spoke it&mdash;now
it sounds like music. Stella, my star, my angel!"</p>

<p>Suddenly his reverie was disturbed by a knock at the door.
With a start, he came back to reality, and got up, but before he
could reach the door it opened, and the countess came in.</p>

<p>"Not in bed?" she said, with a smile.</p>

<p>"I have only just come up," he replied.</p>

<p>The countess smiled again.</p>

<p>"You have been up nearly half an hour."</p>

<p>He was almost guilty of a blush.</p>

<p>"So long!" he said, "I must have been thinking."</p>

<p>And he laughed, as he drew a chair forward. He waited until
she was seated before he resumed his own; never, by word
or deed, did he permit himself to grow lax in courtesy to her;
and then he looked up at her with a smile.</p>

<p>"Have you come for a chat, my lady?" he said, calling her by
her title in the mock-serious way in which he was accustomed
to address her when they were alone.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have come for a chat, Leycester," she said, quietly.</p>

<p>"Does that mean a scold?" he asked, raising his eyebrows, but
still smiling. "Your tone is suspicious, mother. Well, I am at
your mercy."</p>

<p>"I have nothing to scold you for," said the countess, leaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
back in the comfortable chair&mdash;all the chairs were comfortable
in these rooms of his. "Do you feel that you deserve one?"</p>

<p>Lord Leycester was silent. If he had answered he might have
been compelled to admit that perhaps there was some excuse
for complaint in regard to his conduct that evening; silence
was safest.</p>

<p>"No, I have not come to scold you, Leycester. I don't think I
have ever done that," said the countess, softly.</p>

<p>"No, you have been the best of mothers, my lady," he responded.
"I never saw you in an ill temper in my life; perhaps
that is why you look so young. You do look absurdly young,
you know," he added, gazing at her with affectionate admiration.</p>

<p>When the countess seemed lost in thought, Leycester added:</p>

<p>"Devereux says that the majority of English wives and
mothers look so girlish that he believes it must be the custom to
marry them when they are children."</p>

<p>The countess smiled.</p>

<p>"Lord Devereux is master of fine phrases, Leycester. Yes, I
was married very young."</p>

<p>Then she looked round the room: a strange reluctance to commence
the task she had set herself took possession of her.</p>

<p>"You have made your rooms very pretty, Leycester."</p>

<p>He leant back, watching her with a smile.</p>

<p>"You haven't come to talk about my rooms, mother."</p>

<p>Then she straightened herself for her work.</p>

<p>"No, Leycester, I have come to talk about you."</p>

<p>"Rather an uninteresting subject. However, proceed."</p>

<p>"You may make it very hard for me," said the countess, with
a little sigh.</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>"Then you have come to scold?"</p>

<p>"No, only to advise."</p>

<p>"That is generally the same thing under another name."</p>

<p>"I do not often do it," said the countess, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Forgive me," he said, stooping forward and kissing her.
"Now, mother, fire away. What is it? Not about that race
money&mdash;you don't want me to give up the horses?"</p>

<p>The countess smiled almost scornfully.</p>

<p>"Why should I, Leycester; they cost a great deal of money,
but if they amuse you, why&mdash;&mdash;" and she shrugged her shoulders
slightly.</p>

<p>"They do cost a great deal of money," he said, with a laugh,
"but I don't know that they amuse me very much. I don't
think anything amuses me very greatly."</p>

<p>Then the countess looked at him.</p>

<p>"When a man talks like that, Leycester, it generally means
that it is time he was married!"</p>

<p>He half expected what was coming, but he looked grave;
nevertheless he turned to her with a smile.</p>

<p>"Isn't that rather a desperate remedy, my lady?" he said.
"I can give up my horses if they cease to amuse me and bore
me too much; I can give up most of the other so-called amusements,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
but marriage&mdash;supposing that should fail? It would be
rather serious."</p>

<p>"Why should it fail?"</p>

<p>"It does sometimes," he retorted, gravely.</p>

<p>"Not when love enters into it," she answered, gently.</p>

<p>He was silent, his eyes bent on the ground, from which seemed
to rise a slim, girlish figure, with Stella's face and eyes.</p>

<p>"There is no greater happiness than that which marriage
affords when one is married to the person one loves. Do you
think your father has been unhappy, Leycester?"</p>

<p>He turned to her with a smile.</p>

<p>"Every man&mdash;few men have his luck, my lady. Will you
find me another Lady Ethel?"</p>

<p>She colored. This was a direct question, and she longed to
answer it, but she dared not&mdash;not just yet.</p>

<p>"The world is full of fond, loving women," she said.</p>

<p>He nodded. He thought he knew one at least, and his eyes
went to that mental vision of Stella again.</p>

<p>"Leycester, I want to see you married and settled," she murmured,
after a pause. "It is time; it is fitting that you should
be. I'll put the question of your own happiness aside for the
moment; there are other things at stake."</p>

<p>"You would not like me to be the last Earl of Wyndward,
mother? The title would die with me, would it not?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. "That must not be, Leycester."</p>

<p>He shook his head with a quiet smile. No, it should not be,
he thought.</p>

<p>"I wonder," she continued, "that the thing has not come
about before this, and without any word of mine. I don't think
you are very hard-hearted, unimpressionable, Leycester. You
and I have met some beautiful women, and some good and pure
ones. I should not have been surprised if you had come to me
with the confession of your conquest long ago. You would
have come to me, would you not, Leycester?" she asked.</p>

<p>A faint flush stole over his face, and his eyes dropped slightly.
He did not answer for a moment, and she went on as if he had
assented.</p>

<p>"I should have been very glad to have heard of it. I should
have welcomed your choice very heartily."</p>

<p>"Are you sure?" he said, almost mechanically.</p>

<p>"Quite," she answered, serenely. "Your wife will be a
second daughter to me, I hope, Leycester. I know that I should
love her if you do; are we ever at variance?"</p>

<p>"Never until to-night," he might have answered, but he remained
silent.</p>

<p>What if he should turn to her with the frank openness with
which he had gone to her in all his troubles and joys, and say:</p>

<p>"I have made my choice&mdash;welcome her. She is Stella Etheridge,
the painter's daughter."</p>

<p>But he could not do this; he knew so well how she would
have looked at him, saw already with full prophetic insight the
calm, serene smile of haughty incredulity with which she would
have received his demand. He was silent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>"You wonder why I speak to you about this to-night,
Leycester?"</p>

<p>"A little," he said, with a smile that had very little mirth in
it; he felt that he was doing what he had never done before&mdash;concealing
his heart from her, meeting her with secrecy and
evasion, and his proud, finely-tempered mind revolted at the
necessity for it. "A little. I was just considering that I had
not grown older by a score of years, and had not been doing
anything particularly wild. Have they been telling you any
dreadful stories about me, mother, and persuading you that
matrimony is the only thing to save me from ruin?" and he
laughed.</p>

<p>The countess colored.</p>

<p>"No one tells me any stories respecting you, Leycester, for
the simple reason that I should not listen to them. I have nothing
to do with&mdash;with your outer life, unless you yourself make
me part and parcel of it. I am not afraid that you will do anything
bad or dishonorable, Leycester."</p>

<p>"Thanks," he said, quietly. "Then what is it, mother? Why
does this advice press so closely on your soul that you feel constrained
to unburden yourself?"</p>

<p>"Because I feel that the time has come," she said; "because I
have your happiness and welfare so closely at heart that I am
obliged to watch over you, and secure them for you if I
can."</p>

<p>"There never was a mother like you!" he said, gently. "But
this is a serious step, my lady, and I am&mdash;shall I say slightly
unprepared. You speak to me as if I were a sultan, and had
but to throw my handkerchief at any fair maid whom I may
fancy, to obtain her!"</p>

<p>The countess looked at him, and for a moment all her passionate
pride in him shone in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Is there no one to whom you think you could throw that
handkerchief, Leycester?" she asked, significantly.</p>

<p>His face flushed, and his eyes glowed. At that moment he
felt the warm lips of his girl-love resting on his own.</p>

<p>"That is a blunt question, my lady," he said; "would it be
fair to reply, fair to her, supposing that there be one?"</p>

<p>"In whom should you confide but in me?" said the countess,
with a touch of hauteur in her voice, hauteur softened by
love.</p>

<p>He looked down and turned the ruby ring on his finger. If
he could but confide in her!</p>

<p>"In whom else but in me, from whom you have, I think, had
few secrets? If your choice is made, you would come to me,
Leycester? I think you would; I cannot imagine your acting
otherwise. You see I have no fear"&mdash;and she smiled&mdash;"no
fear that your choice would be anything but a good and a wise
one. I know you so well, Leycester. You have been wild&mdash;you
yourself said it, not I!"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, quietly.</p>

<p>"But through it all you have not forgotten the race from
whence you sprung, the name you bear. No, I do not fear that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
most disastrous of all mistakes which a man in your position
can make&mdash;a mesalliance."</p>

<p>He was silent, but his brows drew together.</p>

<p>"You speak strangely, my lady," he said, almost grimly.</p>

<p>"Yes," she assented, calmly, serenely, but with a grave intensity
in her tone which lent significance to every word&mdash;"yes, I
feel strongly. Every mother who has a son in your position
feels as strongly, I doubt not. There are few mad things that
you can do which will not admit of remedy and rectification;
one of them, the worst of them, is a foolish marriage."</p>

<p>"Marriages are made in heaven," he murmured.</p>

<p>"No," she said, gently, "a great many are made in a very
different place. But why need we talk of this? We might as
well discuss whether it would be wise of you to commit manslaughter,
or burglary, or suicide, or any other vulgar crime&mdash;and
indeed a mesalliance would, in your case, strongly resemble
one, suicide; it would be social suicide, at least; and from
what I know of your nature, Leycester, I do not think that
would suit you."</p>

<p>"I think not," he said, grimly. "But, mother, I am not contemplating
a matrimonial union with one of the dairymaids, not
at present."</p>

<p>She smiled.</p>

<p>"You might commit a mesalliance with one in higher position,
Leycester. But why do we talk of this?"</p>

<p>"I think you commenced it," he said.</p>

<p>"Did I?" she said, sweetly. "I beg your pardon. I feel as if
I had insulted you by the mere chance mention of such a thing;
and I have tired you, too."</p>

<p>And she rose with queenly grace.</p>

<p>"No, no," he said, rising, "I am very grateful, mother; you
will believe that?"</p>

<p>"Will you be more than that?" she asked, putting her hand
on his shoulder, and sliding it round his neck. "Will you be
obedient?"</p>

<p>And she smiled at him lovingly.</p>

<p>"Will I get out the handkerchief, do you mean?" he asked,
looking at her with a curious gaze.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied; "make me happy by throwing it."</p>

<p>"And suppose," he said, "that the favored damsel declines
the honor?"</p>

<p>"We will risk that," she murmured, with a smile.</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>"One would think you had already chosen, mother," he
said.</p>

<p>She looked at him, with the smile still shining in her eyes and
on her lips.</p>

<p>"Suppose I have? There is no matchmaker like a mother."</p>

<p>He started.</p>

<p>"You have? You surprise me! May one ask on whom your
choice has fallen, sultaness?"</p>

<p>"Think," she said, in a low voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am thinking very deeply," he answered, with hidden
meaning.</p>

<p>"If I were left to choose for you, I should be very exacting,
Leycester, don't you think?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid so," he said, with a smile. "Every goose thinks
her bantling a swan, and would mate it with an eagle. Forgive
me, mother!"</p>

<p>She inclined her head.</p>

<p>"I should require much. I should want beauty, wealth&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of which we have too much already. Go on."</p>

<p>"Rank, and what is still better, a high position. The Wyndwards
cannot troop with crows, Leycester."</p>

<p>"Beauty, wealth, rank, and a mysterious sort of position. A
princess, perhaps, my lady?"</p>

<p>A proud light shone in her eyes.</p>

<p>"I should not feel abased in the presence of a princess, if you
brought her to me," she said, with that serene hauteur which
characterized her. "No, I am satisfied with less than that,
Leycester."</p>

<p>"I am relieved," he said, smiling. "And this exalted personage&mdash;paragon
I should say&mdash;who is she?"</p>

<p>"Look round&mdash;you need not strain your vision," she returned:
"I can see her now. Oh, blind, blind! that you cannot see her
also! She whom I see is more than all these; she is a woman
with a loving heart in her bosom, that needs but a word to set it
beating for&mdash;you!"</p>

<p>His face flushed.</p>

<p>"I can think of no one," he said. "You make one ashamed,
mother."</p>

<p>"I need not tell you her name, then?" she said.</p>

<p>But he shook his head.</p>

<p>"I must know it now, I think," he said, gravely.</p>

<p>She was silent a moment, then she said in a low voice:</p>

<p>"It is Lenore, Leycester."</p>

<p>He drew away from her, so that her arm fell from his shoulder,
and looked her full in the face.</p>

<p>Before him rose the proud, imperial figure, before him stood
the lovely face of Lenore, with its crown of golden hair, and its
deep, eloquent eyes of violet, and beside it, hovering like a spirit,
the face of his girl-love.</p>

<p>The violet eyes seemed to gaze at him with all the strength of
conscious loveliness, seemed to bend upon him with a glance of
defiance, as if they said&mdash;"I am here, waiting: I smile, you
cannot resist me!" and the dark, tender eyes beside them seemed
to turn upon him with gentle, passionate pleading, praying
him to be constant and faithful.</p>

<p>"Lenore!" he said, in a low voice. "Mother, ought you to
have said this?"</p>

<p>She did not shrink from his almost reproachful gaze.</p>

<p>"Why should I hesitate when my son's happiness is at stake?"
she said, calmly. "If I saw a treasure, some pearl of great
price, lying at your feet, and felt that you were passing it by unnoticed
and disregarded, should I be wrong in speaking the word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
that would place it in your grasp? Your happiness is my&mdash;life
Leycester! If ever there was a treasure, a pearl of great price
among women, it is Lenore. Are you passing her by? You will
not do that!"</p>

<p>Never, since he could remember, had he seen her so moved.
Her voice was calm and even, as usual, but her eyes were warm
with an intense earnestness, the diamonds trembled on her neck.</p>

<p>He stood before her, looking away beyond her, a strange
trouble at his heart. For the first time he saw&mdash;he appreciated,
rather&mdash;the beautiful girl whom, as it were, she held up to his
mental gaze. But that other, that girl-love whose lips still seemed
to murmur, "I love you, Leycester!" What of her!</p>

<p>With a sudden start he moved away.</p>

<p>"I do not think you should have spoken," he said. "You
cannot know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The countess smiled.</p>

<p>"A mother's eyes are quick," she said. "A word and the pearl
is at your feet, Leycester."</p>

<p>He was but a man, warm-blooded and impressionable, and for
a moment his face flushed, but the "I love you" still rang in his
ears.</p>

<p>"If that be so, all the more cause for silence, mother," he said.
"But I hope you are mistaken."</p>

<p>"I am not mistaken," she said. "Do you think," and she
smiled, "that I should have spoken if I had not been sure? Oh,
Leycester," and she moved toward him, "think of her! Is there
any beauty so beautiful as hers; is there any one woman you
have ever met who possessed a tithe of her charms! Think of
her as the head of the house; think of her in my place&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He put up his hand.</p>

<p>"Think of her," she went on, quickly, "as your own, your
very own! Leycester, there is no man born who could turn
away from her!"</p>

<p>Almost involuntarily he turned and went to the fireplace, and
leant upon it.</p>

<p>"There is no man, who, so turning, but would in time give
all that he possessed to come back to her!"</p>

<p>Then her voice changed.</p>

<p>"Leycester, you have been very good. Are you angry?"</p>

<p>"No," he said, and he went to her; "not angry, but&mdash;but
troubled. You think only of me, but I think of Lenore."</p>

<p>"Think of her still!" she said; "and be sure that I have made
no mistake. If you doubt me, put it to the test&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He started.</p>

<p>"And you will find that I am right. I am going now, Leycester.
Good-night!" and she kissed him.</p>

<p>He went to the door and opened it; his face was pale and
grave.</p>

<p>"Good-night," he said, gently. "You have given me something
to think of with a vengeance," and he forced a smile.</p>

<p>She went out without a word. Her maid was waiting for her
in her dressing-room, but she passed into the inner room and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
sank down in a chair, and for the first time her face was pale,
and her eyes anxious.</p>

<p>"It has gone further than I thought," she murmured. "I,
who know every look in his eyes, read his secret. But it shall
not be. I will save him yet. But how? but how?"</p>

<p>Poor Stella!</p>

<p>Lord Leicester, left alone, fell to pacing the room, his brow
bent, his mind in a turmoil.</p>

<p>He loved his mother with a passionate devotion, part and parcel
of his nature. Every word she had said had sunk into his
mind; he loved her, and he knew her; he knew that she would
rather die than give her consent to his marriage with such an
one as Stella, pure and good and sweet though she was.</p>

<p>He was greatly troubled, but he stood firm.</p>

<p>"Come what will," he murmured, "I cannot part with her.
<i>She</i> is my treasure and pearl of great price, and I have not
passed her by. My darling!"</p>

<p>Suddenly, breaking into his reverie, came a knock at the door.</p>

<p>He went to open it but it opened before he could reach it,
and Lord Charles walked in.</p>

<p>There was a smile on his handsome, light-hearted face, which
barely hid an expression of affectionate sympathy.</p>

<p>"Anything the matter, old man?" he said, closing the door.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;no&mdash;not much&mdash;why?" said Leycester, forcing a smile.</p>

<p>"Why!" echoed Lord Charles, thrusting his hands into the
huge pockets of his dressing-gown, and eying him with mock
reproach. "Can you ask when you remember that my room is
exactly underneath yours, and that it sounds as if you had
turned this into the den of a traveling menagerie? What are
you wearing the carpet out for, Ley?" and he sat down and
looked up at the troubled face with that frank sincerity which
invites confidence.</p>

<p>"I'm in a fix," said Leycester.</p>

<p>"Come on," said Lord Charles, curtly.</p>

<p>"I can't. You can't help me in this," said Leycester, with a
sigh.</p>

<p>Lord Charles rose at once.</p>

<p>"Then I'll go. I wish I could. What have you been doing,
Ley?&mdash;something to-night, I expect. Never mind; if I can help
you, you'll let me know."</p>

<p>Leycester threw him a cigar-case.</p>

<p>"Sit down and smoke, Charlie," he said. "I can't open my
mind, but I want to think, and you'll help me. Is it late?"</p>

<p>"Awfully," said Lord Charles with a yawn. "What a jolly
evening it has been. I say, Ley, haven't you been carrying it
on rather thick with that pretty girl with the dark eyes?"</p>

<p>Leycester paused in his task of lighting a cigar, and looked
down at him.</p>

<p>"Which girl?" he said, with a little touch of hauteur in his
face.</p>

<p>"The painter's niece," said Lord Charles. "What a beautiful
girl she is! Reminds me of a what-do-you-call-it."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>"A&mdash;a gazelle. It's rather a pity that she should be intended
for that saucy lawyer fellow."</p>

<p>"What?" asked Lord Leycester, quietly.</p>

<p>"Haven't you heard?" said Lord Charles, grimly. "The fellows
were talking about it in the billiard-room."</p>

<p>"About what?" demanded Lord Leycester, still quietly, though
his eyes glittered. Stella the common talk of the billiard-room.
It was desecration.</p>

<p>"Oh, it was Longford, he knows the man!"</p>

<p>"What man?"</p>

<p>"This Jasper Adelstone she is engaged to."</p>

<p>Lord Leycester held the cigar to his lips, and his teeth closed
over it with a sudden fierce passion.</p>

<p>Coming upon all that had passed, this was the last straw.</p>

<p>"It's a lie!" he said.</p>

<p>Lord Charles looked up with a start, then his face grew grave.</p>

<p>"Perhaps so," he said; "but, after all, it can't matter to you,
Ley."</p>

<p>Lord Leycester turned away in silence.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Jasper Adelstone</span> was in love.</p>

<p>It was some time before he would bring himself to admit it
even to himself, for he was wont to pride himself on his superiority
to all attacks of the tender passion.</p>

<p>Often and often had he amused himself and his chosen companions
by ridiculing the conditions of those weak mortals who
allowed themselves to be carried away by what he termed a weak
and contemptible affection for the other sex.</p>

<p>Marriage, he used to say, was entirely a matter of business. A
man didn't marry until he was obliged, and then only did so to
better himself. As to love, and that kind of thing&mdash;well, it was
an exploded idea&mdash;a myth which had died out; at any rate, too
absurd a thing altogether for a man possessed of common sense&mdash;for
such a man, for instance, as Jasper Adelstone. He had
seen plenty of pretty women and was received by them with anything
but disfavor. He was good-looking, almost handsome, and
would have been that if he could have got rid of the sharp, cunning
glint of his small eyes; and he was clever and accomplished.
He was just the man, it would have been supposed, to fall
a victim to the tender passion; but he had stuck fast by his
principles, and gone stealthily along the road to success, with
his cold smile ready for everyone in general, and not a warm
beam in his heart for anyone in particular.</p>

<p>And now! Yes, he was in love&mdash;in love as deeply, unreasoningly,
as impulsively as the veriest school-boy.</p>

<p>This was very annoying! It would have been very annoying
if the object of his passion had been an heiress or the lady of
title whom he had in his inmost mind determined to marry, if
he married at all; for he would have preferred to have attained
to his ambition without any awkward and inconvenient love-making.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>But the girl who had inspired him with this sudden and unreasoning
passion was, much to his disgust, neither an heiress
nor an offshoot of nobility.</p>

<p>She was a mere nobody&mdash;the niece of an obscure painter! She
was not even in society!</p>

<p>There was no good to be got by marrying her, none whatever.
She could not help him a single step on his ambitious path
through life. On the first evening of his meeting with Stella,
when the beauty, and, more than her beauty, the nameless charm
of her bright, pure freshness, overwhelmed and startled him, he
took himself to task very seriously.</p>

<p>"Jasper," he said, "you won't go and make a fool of yourself,
I hope! She is entirely out of your line. She is only a pretty
girl; you've seen a score, a hundred as pretty, or prettier; and
she's a mere nobody! Oh, no, you won't make a fool of yourself&mdash;you'll
go back to town to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>But he did not go back to town; instead, he went into the conservatory
at the Rectory, and made up a bouquet and took it
to the cottage, and sank deeper still into the mire of foolishness,
as he would have called it.</p>

<p>But even then it was not too late. He might have escaped
even then by dint of calling up his selfish nature and thinking
of all his ambitions; but Stella unfortunately roused&mdash;what was
more powerful in him than his sudden love&mdash;his self-conceit.</p>

<p>She actually dared to defend Lord Leycester Wyndward!</p>

<p>That was almost the finishing stroke, unwittingly dealt by
Stella, and he went away inwardly raging with incipient jealousy.</p>

<p>But the last straw was yet to come that should break the back
of all his prudent resolves, and that was the meeting with Stella
and Lord Leycester in the river-woods, and Lord Leycester's
attack on him.</p>

<p>That moment&mdash;the moment when he lay on the ground looking
up at the dark, handsome, angry, and somewhat scornful face of
the young peer&mdash;Jasper Adelstone registered a vow.</p>

<p>He vowed that come what would, by fair means or foul, he
would have Stella.</p>

<p>He vowed that he would snatch her from the haughty and
fiery young lord who had dared to hurl him, Jasper, to the dust
and insult him.</p>

<p>What love he already possessed for her suddenly sprang up
into a fierce flame of jealous passion, and as he rode home to the
Rectory he repeated that vow several times, and at once, without
the loss of an hour, began to hunt about for some means to
fulfill it.</p>

<p>He was no fool, this Jasper Adelstone, for all his conceit, and
he knew the immense odds against him if Lord Leycester really
meant anything by his attention to Stella; he knew what fearful
advantages Leycester held&mdash;all the Court cards were in his
hands. He was handsome, renowned, noble, wealthy&mdash;a suitor
whom the highest in the land would think twice about before
refusing.</p>

<p>He almost guessed, too, that Stella already loved Leycester;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
he had seen her face turned to the young lord&mdash;had heard her
voice as she spoke to him.</p>

<p>He ground his teeth together with vicious rage as he thought
of the difference between her way of speaking to him and to
Leycester.</p>

<p>"But she shall speak to me, look at me like that before the
game is over," he swore to himself. "I can afford to wait for
my opportunity; it will come, and I shall know how to use it.
Curse him! Yes, I am determined now. I will take him from
her."</p>

<p>It was a bold, audacious resolution; but then Jasper was both
bold and audacious in the most dangerous of ways, in the cold,
calculating manner of a cunning, unscrupulous man.</p>

<p>He was clever&mdash;undoubtedly clever; he had been very successful,
and had made that success by his own unaided efforts.
Already, young as he was, he was beginning to be talked about.
When people were in any great difficulty in his branch of the
law, they went to him, sure of finding him cool, ready, and
capable.</p>

<p>His chambers in the inn held a little museum of secrets&mdash;secrets
about persons of rank and standing, who were supposed
to be quite free from such inconvenient things as skeletons in
cupboards.</p>

<p>People came to him when they were in any social fix; when
they owed more money than they could pay; when they wanted
a divorce, or were anxious to hush up some secret, whose threatened
disclosure involved shame and disgrace, and Jasper Adelstone
was always ready with sound advice, and, better still,
some subtle scheme or plan.</p>

<p>Yes, he was a successful man, and had failed so seldom&mdash;almost
never&mdash;that he felt he could be confident in this matter, too.</p>

<p>"I have always done well for others," he thought. "I have
gained some difficult points for other people; now I will undertake
this difficult matter for myself."</p>

<p>He went home to the Rectory and pondered, recalling all he
knew of old Etheridge. It was very little, and the rector could
tell him no more than he knew already.</p>

<p>James Etheridge lived the life of a recluse, appearing to have
no friends or relations save Stella; nothing was known about his
former life. He had come down into the quiet valley some
years ago, and settled at once in the mode of existence which
was palpable to all.</p>

<p>"Is he, was he, ever married?" asked Jasper.</p>

<p>The rector thought not.</p>

<p>"I don't know," he said. "He certainly hasn't been married
down here. I don't think anything is known about him."</p>

<p>And with this Jasper had to be content. All the next day,
after his meeting with Stella and Leycester, he strolled about
the meadows hoping to see her, but failed. He knew he ought
to be in London, but he could not tear himself away.</p>

<p>His arm felt a little stiff, and though there was nothing else
the matter with it, he bound it up and hung it in a sling, explaining
to the rector that he had fallen from his horse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he heard of the party at the Hall, and grinding his teeth
with envy and malice, he stole into the lane and watched Stella
start.</p>

<p>In his eyes she looked doubly beautiful since he had sworn to
have her, and he wandered about the lane and meadows thinking
of her, and thinking, too, of Lord Leycester all that evening, waiting
for her to return, to get one look at her.</p>

<p>Fortune favored him with more than a look, for while he was
waiting the boy from the post-office came down the lane, and
Jasper, with very little difficulty, persuaded him to give up the
telegram to his keeping.</p>

<p>I am sorry to say that Jasper was very much tempted to open
that telegram, and if he resisted the temptation, it was not in
consequence of any pangs of conscience, but because he thought
that it would scarcely be worth while.</p>

<p>"It is only some commission for a picture," he said to himself.
"People don't communicate secretly by telegram excepting in
cipher."</p>

<p>So he delivered it unopened as we know, but when he heard that
sudden exclamation of the old man's he was heartily sorry he had
not opened it.</p>

<p>When he parted from Stella at the gate, he walked off down the
lane, but only until out of sight, and then returned under the
shadow of the hedge and waited.</p>

<p>He could see into the studio, and see the old man sitting in the
chair bowed with sorrow; and Stella's graceful figure hovering
about him.</p>

<p>"There was something worth knowing in that telegram," he
muttered. "I was a fool not to make myself acquainted with it.
What will he do now?"</p>

<p>He thought the question out, still watching, and the old man's
movements seen plainly through the lighted windows&mdash;for Stella
had only drawn the muslin curtain too hurriedly and imperfectly&mdash;afforded
an answer.</p>

<p>"He is going up to town," he muttered.</p>

<p>He knew that there was an early market train, and felt sure
that the old man was going by it.</p>

<p>Hastily glancing at his watch, he set his hat firmly on his head,
dipped his arm out of the sling, and ran toward the Rectory;
entering by a side door he went to his room, took a bag containing
some papers, secured his coat and umbrella, and leaving a note
on the breakfast-table to the effect that he was suddenly obliged
to go to town, made for the station.</p>

<p>As he did not wish to be seen, he kept in the shadow and waited,
and was rewarded in a few minutes by the appearance of Mr.
Etheridge.</p>

<p>There was no one on the station beside themselves, and Jasper
had no difficulty in keeping out of the old man's way. A sleepy
porter sauntered up and down, yawning and swinging his lantern,
and Jasper decided that he wouldn't trouble him by taking
a ticket.</p>

<p>The train came up, Mr. Etheridge got into a first-class carriage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
and Jasper, waiting until the last moment, sprang into
one at the further end of the train.</p>

<p>"Never mind the ticket," he said to the porter. "I'll pay at
the other end."</p>

<p>The train was an express from Wyndward, and Jasper, who
knew how to take care of himself, pulled the curtains closed,
drew a traveling cap from his bag, and curling himself up went
to sleep, while the old man, a few carriages further off, sat with
his white head bowed in sorrowful and wakeful meditation.</p>

<p>When the train arrived at the terminus, Jasper, awaking from
a refreshing sleep, drew aside the curtain and watched Mr.
Etheridge get out, waited until he approached the cab-stand,
then following up behind him nearer, heard him tell the cabman
to drive him to King's Hotel, Covent Garden.</p>

<p>Then Jasper called a cab and drove to the square in which his
chambers were situated, dismissed the cab, and saw it crawl
away out of sight, and climbed up the staircase which served as
the approach to the many doors which lined the narrow grim
passages.</p>

<p>On one of these doors his name was inscribed in black letters;
he opened this door with a key, struck a light, and lit a candle
which stood on a ledge, and entered a small room which served
for the purpose of a clerk's office and a client's waiting-room.</p>

<p>Beyond this, and communicating by a green baize door, was
his own business-room, but there were still other rooms behind,
one his living-room, another in which he slept, and beyond that
a smaller room.</p>

<p>He entered this, and holding the light on high allowed its
rays to fall upon a man lying curled up on a small bed.</p>

<p>He was a very small man, with a thin, parchment-lined face,
crowned by closely-cropped hair, which is ambiguously described
as auburn.</p>

<p>This was Jasper's clerk, factotum, slave. He it was who sat
in the outer office and received the visitors, and ushered them
into Jasper's presence or put them off with excuses.</p>

<p>He was a singular-looking man, no particular age or individuality.
Some of Jasper's friends were often curious as to where
Jasper had picked him up, but Jasper always evaded the question
or put it by with some jest, and Scrivell's antecedents remained
a mystery.</p>

<p>That he was a devoted and never tiring servant was palpable
to all; in Jasper's presence he seemed to live only to obey his
will and anticipate his wishes. Now, at the first touch of Jasper's
hand, the man started and sat bolt upright, screening his
eyes from the light and staring at Jasper expectantly.</p>

<p>"Awake, Scrivell?" asked Jasper.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, quite," was the reply; and indeed he looked as if
he had been on the alert for hours past.</p>

<p>"That's right. I want you. Get up and dress and come into
the next room. I'll leave the candle."</p>

<p>"You needn't, sir," was the reply. "I can see."</p>

<p>Jasper nodded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>"I believe you can&mdash;like a cat," he said, and carried the card
with him.</p>

<p>In a few minutes&mdash;in a very few minutes&mdash;the door opened and
Scrivell entered.</p>

<p>He looked wofully thin and emaciated, was dressed in an old
but still respectable suit of black, and might have been taken for
an old man but for the sharp, alert look in his gray eyes, and the
sandy hair, which showed no signs of gray.</p>

<p>Jasper was sitting before his dressing-table opening his letters,
which he had carried in from the other room.</p>

<p>"Oh, here you are," he said. "I want you to go out."</p>

<p>Scrivell nodded.</p>

<p>"Do you know King's Hotel, Covent Garden?" asked Jasper.</p>

<p>"King's? Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, I want you to go down there."</p>

<p>He paused, but he might have known the man would not express
any surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," he said, as coolly as if Jasper had told him to go to
bed again.</p>

<p>"I want you to go down there and keep a look-out for me. A
gentleman has just driven there, an old man, rather bent, with
long white hair. Understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes," was the quiet reply.</p>

<p>"He will probably go out the first thing, quite early. I want
to know where he goes."</p>

<p>"Only the first place he goes to?" was the question.</p>

<p>Jasper hesitated.</p>

<p>"Suppose you keep an eye upon him generally till, say one
o'clock, then come back to me. I want to know his movements,
you understand, Scrivell!"</p>

<p>"I understand, sir," was the answer. "Any name?"</p>

<p>Jasper hesitated a moment, and a faint color came into his face.
Somehow he was conscious of a strange reluctance to mention the
name&mdash;her name; but he overcame it.</p>

<p>"Yes, Etheridge," he said, quietly, "but that doesn't matter.
Don't make any inquiries at the hotel or elsewhere, if you can
help it."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," said the man, and noiselessly he turned and
left the room.</p>

<p>Little did Stella, dreaming in the cottage by the sweet smelling
meadows and the murmuring river, think that the first woof of
the web which Jasper Adelstone was spinning for her was commenced
that night in the grim chambers of Lincoln's-inn.</p>

<p>As little did Lady Wyndward guess, as she lay awake, vainly
striving to find some means of averting the consequences of her
son's "infatuation" for the painter's niece, that a keener and less
scrupulous mind had already set to work in the same direction.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Jasper</span> undressed and went to bed, and slept as soundly as men
of his peculiar caliber do sleep, while Scrivell was standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
at the corner of a street in Covent Garden, with his hands in his
pockets and his eyes on the entrance to King's Hotel. A little
after nine Jasper awoke, had his bath, dressed, went out, got
some breakfast, and sat down to work, and for the time being
forgot&mdash;actually forgot&mdash;that such an individual as Stella Etheridge
existed.</p>

<p>That was the secret of his power, that he could concentrate
his attention on one subject to the absolute abnegation of all
others.</p>

<p>Several visitors put in an appearance on business, Jasper
opening the door by means of a wire which drew back the
handle, without moving.</p>

<p>At about half-past twelve someone knocked. Jasper opened
the door, and a tall, fashionably-dressed young gentleman entered.</p>

<p>It was a certain Captain Halliday, who had been one of the
guests at Wyndward Hall on the first night of our introduction
there.</p>

<p>Captain Halliday was a man about town; one who had been
rich, but who had worked very hard to make himself poor&mdash;and
nearly succeeded. He was a well-known man, and a member
of a fast club, at which high play formed the chief amusement.</p>

<p>Jasper knew him socially, and got up&mdash;a thing he did not
often do&mdash;to shake hands.</p>

<p>"How do you do?" he said, motioning him to a chair. "Anything
I can do for you?"</p>

<p>It was generally understood by Jasper's acquaintances that
Jasper's time was money, and they respected the hours devoted
by him to business.</p>

<p>Captain Halliday smiled.</p>

<p>"You always come to the point, Adelstone," he replied.
"Yes, I want a little advice."</p>

<p>Jasper sat down and clasped his hands over his knee; they
were very white and carefully-kept hands.</p>

<p>"Hope I may be able to give it to you. What is it?"</p>

<p>"Well look here," said the captain, "you don't mind my
smoking a cigarette, do you? I can always talk better while I
am smoking."</p>

<p>"Not at all&mdash;I like it," said Jasper.</p>

<p>"But the lady clients?" said the captain, with a little contraction
of the eyelids, which was suspiciously near a wink.</p>

<p>"I don't think they mind," said Jasper. "They are generally
too occupied with their own business to notice. A light?" and
he handed the wax tapers which stood on his desk for sealing
purposes.</p>

<p>The captain lighted his cigarette slowly. It was evident that
the matter upon which he required advice was delicate, and only
to be attacked with much deliberation.</p>

<p>"Look here!" he began; "I've come upon rather an awkward
business."</p>

<p>Jasper smiled. It not unfrequently happened that his clients
came to him for money, and not unfrequently he managed to
find some for them&mdash;of course through some friend, always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
through some friend "in the City," who demanded and obtained
a tolerably large interest.</p>

<p>Jasper smiled, and wondered how much the captain wanted,
and whether it would be safe to lend it.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he said.</p>

<p>"You know the Rookery?" asked the captain.</p>

<p>Jasper nodded.</p>

<p>"I was there the other night&mdash;I'm there every night, I'm
afraid," he added; "but I am referring to the night before
last&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jasper, intending to help him. "And luck went
against you, and you lost a pile."</p>

<p>"No, I didn't," said the captain; "I won a pile."</p>

<p>"I congratulate you," said Jasper, with a cool smile.</p>

<p>"I won a pile!" said the captain, "from all round; but
principally from a young fellow&mdash;a mere boy, who was there as
a visitor, introduced by young Bellamy&mdash;know young Bellamy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said Jasper&mdash;he was very busy. "Everybody
knows Bellamy. Well!"</p>

<p>"Well, the young fellow&mdash;I was awfully sorry for him, and
tried to persuade him to turn it up, but he wouldn't. You know
what youngsters are when they are green at this confounded
game?"</p>

<p>Jasper nodded again rather more impatiently. Scrivell would
be back directly, and he was anxious to hear the result of his
scrutiny.</p>

<p>"Luck went with him at first, and he won a good deal, but it
turned after a time and I was the better by a cool hundred and
fifty; I stopped at that&mdash;it was too much as it was to win from
a youngster, and he gave me his I O U."</p>

<p>The captain paused and lit another cigarette.</p>

<p>"Next morning, being rather pressed&mdash;did I tell you I went
home with Gooch and one or two others and lost the lot?" he
broke off, simply.</p>

<p>Jasper smiled.</p>

<p>"No, you did not mention it, but I can quite believe it. Go on."</p>

<p>"Next morning, being rather pressed&mdash;I wanted to pay my
own I O U's&mdash;I looked him up to collect his."</p>

<p>"And he put you off, and you want me to help you," said
Jasper, smiling behind his white hand.</p>

<p>"No, I don't. I wish you'd hear me out," said the captain,
not unnaturally aggrieved by the repeated interruption.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon!" said Jasper. "I thought I should help
to bring you to the point. But, there, tell it your own way."</p>

<p>"He didn't refuse; he gave me a bill," said the captain; "said
he was sorry he couldn't manage the cash, but expecting me to
call had got a bill ready."</p>

<p>"Which you naturally declined to accept from a perfect
stranger," said Jasper.</p>

<p>"Which I did nothing of the sort," said the captain, coolly.
"It was backed by Bellamy, and that was good enough for me.
Bellamy's name written across the back, making himself responsible
for the money, if the young fellow didn't pay."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>"I understand what a bill is," said Jasper, with a smile.</p>

<p>"Of course," assented the captain, puffing at his cigarette,
"Bellamy's name, mind, which was good enough for me."</p>

<p>"And for most people."</p>

<p>"Well, I meant to get some fellow to discount this, get some
money for it, you know, but happening to meet Bellamy at the
club, it occurred to me that he mightn't like the bill hawked
about, so I asked him if he'd take it up. See?"</p>

<p>"Quite. Whether he'd give you the money for it&mdash;the hundred
and fifty pounds. I see," said Jasper. "Well?"</p>

<p>"Well, I put it rather delicately&mdash;there was a lot of fellows
about&mdash;and he didn't seem to understand me. 'What bill do
you mean, old man?' he said. 'I took an oath not to fly any
more paper a year ago, and I've kept it, by George!'"</p>

<p>Jasper leant forward slightly; the keen, hard look which
comes into the eyes of a hound that suddenly scents game, came
into his. But this time he did not speak; as was usual with him
when interested, he remained silent.</p>

<p>"Well, I flatter myself I played a cool hand," said the captain,
complacently flicking the ash from his cigarette. "I knew
the bill was a&mdash;a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Forgery," said Jasper, coldly.</p>

<p>The captain nodded gravely.</p>

<p>"A forgery. But I felt for the poor young beggar, and didn't
want to be hard on him; so I pretended to Bellamy that I'd
made a mistake and meant somebody else, and explained that
I'd been at the champagne rather freely the other night; and&mdash;you
know Bellamy&mdash;he was satisfied."</p>

<p>"Well?" said Jasper, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Well, then I took a cab, and drove to 22 Percival street&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused abruptly, and bit his lip; but Jasper, though he
heard the address, and had stamped it, as it were, on his
memory, showed no sign of having noticed it, and examined his
nails curiously.</p>

<p>"I drove to the young fellow's rooms, and he confessed to it.
Poor young beggar! I pitied him from the bottom of my heart&mdash;I
did indeed. Wrong, I know. Justice, and example, and all
that, you'll say; but if you'd seen him, with his head buried in
his hands, and his whole frame shaking like a leaf, why, you'd
have pitied him yourself."</p>

<p>Jasper put up his hand to his mouth to hide a sneer.</p>

<p>"Very likely," he said&mdash;"most likely. I have a particularly
soft heart for&mdash;forgers."</p>

<p>The captain started slightly. It was a horrible word!</p>

<p>"I don't believe the young beggar meant it, not in cold blood,
you know; but he was so knocked of a heap by my dropping
down upon him, and so afraid of looking like a welsher that the
idea of the bill struck him, and he did it. He swears that Bellamy
and he are such chums, that Bellamy wouldn't have
minded."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Jasper, with a smile, "the judge and jury will
look at that in a different light."</p>

<p>"The judge and jury! What do you mean?" demanded the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
captain. "You don't think I'm going to&mdash;what's-its-name&mdash;prosecute?"</p>

<p>"Then what are you here for?" Jasper was going to say, but
politely corrected it to "Then what can I do for you?"</p>

<p>"Well, here's the strange part of the story! I went home to
find the bill and tear it up&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jasper smiled again, and again hid the delicate sneer.</p>

<p>"But if you'll believe me, I couldn't find it! What do you
think I'd done with it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Jasper. "Lit your cigar with it!"</p>

<p>"No; in a fit of absence of mind&mdash;we'll call it champagne cup
and brandy-and-soda!&mdash;I'd given it to old Murphy with some other
bills in payment of a debt. Think of that! There's that poor
young beggar almost out of his mind with remorse and terror,
and that old wretch, Murphy, has got that bill! And if it isn't
got from him he'll have the law of young&mdash;of the boy as sure
as Fate is Fate!"</p>

<p>"Yes; I know Murphy," said Jasper with delicious coolness.
"He'd be so wild that he'd not rest satisfied until he'd sent your
fast young friend across the herring-pond."</p>

<p>"But he mustn't! I should never forgive myself! Think of
it, Adelstone! Quite a young boy&mdash;a curly-headed young beggar
that ought to be forgiven a little thing of this sort!"</p>

<p>"A little thing!" and Jasper laughed.</p>

<p>He also rose and looked as if he had already expended as
much of his time as he could afford.</p>

<p>"Well?" he said.</p>

<p>"Well!" echoed the captain. "Now I want you to send for
that bill, Adelstone, and get it at once."</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Jasper. "I may be permitted to mention
that you are doing rather a&mdash;well, very injudicious thing? You
are losing a hundred and fifty pounds to save your gentleman
from&mdash;well, departing for that bourne to which he will certainly
sooner or later wend. He will get transported sooner or later; a
youngster who begins like this always goes on. Why lose a
hundred and fifty pounds? But there," he added, seeing a look
of quiet determination on the captain's honest, if simple, face,
"that is your business; mine is to give you advice, and I've
done it. If you'll write a check for the amount, I'll send my
clerk over to Murphy's. He is out at present, but he'll be back,"
looking at the clock, "before you have written the check,"
and he handed the captain a pen, and motioned him politely to
the desk.</p>

<p>But the captain changed color, and laughed with some embarrassment.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said, "look here, Adelstone, it isn't quite
convenient to write a check&mdash;confound it! You talk as if I
had the old balance at my bankers! I can't do it. I ask you to
lend me the money&mdash;see?"</p>

<p>Jasper gave a start of surprise though he felt none. He knew
what had been coming.</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry, my dear fellow," he said. "But I'm afraid
I can't do it. I am very short this morning, and have some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
heavy matters to meet. I've been buying some shares for a
client, and am quite cleared out for the present."</p>

<p>"But," pleaded the captain, earnestly, more earnestly than he
had ever pleaded for a loan on his own account, "but think of
the youngster, Adelstone."</p>

<p>Then Jasper smiled&mdash;a hard, cold smile.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Halliday," he said, thrusting his hands in his
pockets, "but I have been thinking of him, and I can't see my
way to doing this for a young scoundrel&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He's no scoundrel," said the captain, with a flush.</p>

<p>"A young forger, then, if you prefer it, my dear fellow," said
Jasper, with a cold laugh, "who ought to be punished, if anyone
deserves punishment. Why, it is compounding a felony!"
he added, virtuously.</p>

<p>"Oh, come!" said the captain, with a troubled smile, "that's
nonsense, you talking like that! I want the matter hushed up,
Adelstone."</p>

<p>"Well, though I don't agree with you, I won't argue the
matter," said Jasper, "but I can't lend you the money to hush
it up with, Halliday. If it were for yourself, now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was something in Jasper's cold face, in his compressed,
almost sneering lips, and hard, keen eyes, that convinced the
captain any further time expended in endeavoring to soften
Jasper Adelstone's heart would be time wasted.</p>

<p>"Never mind," he said, "I'm sorry I've taken up your time.
Good-morning. Of course this is quite confidential, you know,
eh?"</p>

<p>Jasper raised his eyebrows and smiled pleasantly.</p>

<p>"My dear Halliday, you are in a lawyer's office. Nothing
that occurs within these walls gets out, unless the client wishes
it. Your little story is as safely locked up in my bosom as if you
had never told it. Good-morning."</p>

<p>The captain put on his hat and turned to go, but at that
moment the door opened and Scrivell entered.</p>

<p>"I beg pardon," he said, and drew back, but paused, and,
instead of going out, walked up to Jasper's desk, and laid a
piece of paper on it.</p>

<p>Jasper took it up eagerly. There was one line written on it,
and it was this:</p>

<p>"22 Percival street!"</p>

<p>Jasper did not start; he did not even change color, but his lips
tightened, and a gleam of eagerness shot from his eyes.</p>

<p>With the paper in his hand, he looked up carelessly.</p>

<p>"All right, Scrivell. Oh, by the way, just run after Captain
Halliday, and tell him I should like another word with him."</p>

<p>Scrivell disappeared, and in another minute the captain re-entered.</p>

<p>He still looked rather downcast.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he said, with his hand on the door.</p>

<p>Jasper went and closed it; then he laughed in his quiet, noiseless
way.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you'll think me a soft kind of lawyer, Halliday,
but this story of yours has touched me; it has, indeed!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>The captain nodded, and dropped into a chair.</p>

<p>"I thought it had," he said, simply. "Touch anybody,
wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" said Jasper, with a sigh. "It's very wrong, you
know&mdash;altogether out of the line, but I suppose you've set your
heart on hushing it up, eh?"</p>

<p>"I have, indeed," said the captain, eagerly. "And if you
knew all you'd say the same."</p>

<p>"Haven't you told me all?" said Jasper, quietly. "I don't
mean the boy's name; you can keep that if you like."</p>

<p>"No, I don't mean to conceal anything, if you'll help me,"
said the captain ingenuously. "Of course if you had decided
not to, I should have kept dark about his name."</p>

<p>"Of course," said Jasper, with a smile; and he glanced at the
slip of paper. "Well, perhaps you'd better tell me all, hadn't
you?"</p>

<p>"I think I had," assented the captain. "Well, the youngster's
name is&mdash;Etheridge?"</p>

<p>"Ether&mdash;how do you spell it?" asked Jasper, carelessly.</p>

<p>The captain spelt it.</p>

<p>"Not a common name, and he's anything but a common boy;
he's a handsome youngster, and I couldn't help pitying him, because
he has been left to himself so much&mdash;no friends, and all
that sort of thing."</p>

<p>"How's that?" asked Jasper, with his eyes cast down, a hungry
eagerness eating at his heart. There was some mystery
after all, then, about the old man!</p>

<p>"Well, it is this way. It seems he's the son of an old man&mdash;a
painter, or a writer, or something, who lives away in the country,
and who can't bear this boy near him."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Jasper, examining his nails.</p>

<p>"Because he's like his mother," said the captain, simply.</p>

<p>"And she&mdash;&mdash;?" said Jasper, softly.</p>

<p>"She ran away with another man, and left her boy behind&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I understand."</p>

<p>"Yes," resumed the captain. "Usual thing, the husband,
this boy's father, was awfully cut up; left the world and buried
himself and sent the boy away, treated him very well, though,
all the same; sent him to Eton, and to Cambridge, under the care
of a tutor, and that sort of thing, but couldn't bear to see him.
He's up now for the holidays&mdash;the boy, I mean!"</p>

<p>"I understand," said Jasper, in a low voice. "Quite a story,
isn't it? And"&mdash;he paused to throw the piece of paper on the
fire&mdash;"do you think the boy has communicated with the father
ever since?"</p>

<p>"Heaven knows&mdash;not unlikely. He said something about
telegraphing."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; just so," said Jasper, carelessly. "Well, it will be
inconvenient, but I suppose I must do what you want. The
sooner we get this over the better," and he sat down and drew
out his check book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thanks, thanks!" muttered the captain. "I didn't think a
good fellow like you would stand back; I didn't, indeed!"</p>

<p>"I ought not to do it," murmured Jasper, with a shake of the
head, as he rang the bell.</p>

<p>"Take this letter to Murphy, and wait, Scrivell," he said.</p>

<p>Scrivell disappeared noiselessly.</p>

<p>"By the way," said Jasper, "have you mentioned this to any
one excepting me?"</p>

<p>"Not to a soul," replied the captain; "and you bet, I shall not
of course."</p>

<p>"Of course," said Jasper, with a smile; "it wouldn't be worth
spending a hundred and fifty to hush it up if you did. Mention
such a thing to one person&mdash;excepting me, of course,"&mdash;and he
smiled&mdash;"and you let the whole world know. Where did you
get all this information?"</p>

<p>"From Bellamy, the boy's chum," said the captain. "He
asked me to look him up occasionally."</p>

<p>"I see," said Jasper. "You won't mind my writing a letter
or two, will you?"</p>

<p>"Go on," said the captain, lighting the fifth cigarette.</p>

<p>Jasper went to a cupboard and brought out a small bottle of
champagne and a couple of glasses.</p>

<p>"The generous glow of so virtuous an action&mdash;which by-the-way
is strictly illegal&mdash;suggests something to drink," he said,
with a smile.</p>

<p>The captain nodded.</p>

<p>"I didn't know you did this sort of thing here," he said, looking
round.</p>

<p>"I don't as a rule," said Jasper, with a dry smile. "Will you
slip that bolt into the door?"</p>

<p>The captain, greatly enjoying anything in the shape of an irregularity,
did as he was bidden, and the two sat and sipped their
wine, and Jasper threw off his dry business air and chatted
about things in general until Scrivell knocked. Jasper opened
the door for him and took an envelope from his hand and carried
it to the desk.</p>

<p>"Well?" said the captain, eagerly.</p>

<p>"All right," said Jasper, holding up the bill.</p>

<p>The captain drew a long breath of relief.</p>

<p>"I feel as if I had done it myself," he said, with a laugh.
"Poor young beggar, he'll be glad to know he's to get off scot
free."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Jasper. "By-the-way, hadn't you better drop
him a line?"</p>

<p>"Right," exclaimed the captain, eagerly; "that's a good idea.
May I write it here?"</p>

<p>Jasper pushed a sheet of plain paper before him and an envelope.</p>

<p>"Don't date it from here," he said; "date it from your lodgings.
You don't want him to know that anybody else knows anything
about it, of course."</p>

<p>"Of course not! How thoughtful you are. That's the best of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
a lawyer&mdash;always keeps his head cool," and he drew up a chair,
and wrote not in the best of hands or the best of spelling:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Dear Mr. Etheridge&mdash;I've got&mdash;you know what. It is all
right. Nothing more need be said. Be a good boy for the future."</p>

<p>"Yours truly,</p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Harry Halliday</span>."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>"How's that?" he asked, handing the note to Jasper.</p>

<p>Jasper looked up; he was bending over his desk, apparently
writing a letter, and looked up with an absent expression.</p>

<p>"Eh?" he said. "Oh, yes; that will do. Stop though, to set
his mind quite at rest, better say that you have destroyed it&mdash;as
you have, see!" and he took the envelope and held it over the
taper until it burnt down nearly to his finger, dropping the remaining
fragment on the desk and allowing it to turn and
smolder away.</p>

<p>The captain added the line to that effect.</p>

<p>"Now your man can run with it, if you'll be so good."</p>

<p>Jasper smiled.</p>

<p>"No," he said. "I think not. I'll send a commissionaire."</p>

<p>He rang the bell and took up the letter.</p>

<p>"Send this by the commissionaire," he said. "There is no
answer. Tell him to give it in and come away."</p>

<p>"And now I'm off," said the captain. "I'll let you have a
check in a day or two, Adelstone, and I'm very much obliged
to you."</p>

<p>"All right," said Jasper, with a slightly absent air as if his
mind was already engaged with other matters. "No hurry;
whenever it's convenient. Good-bye!"</p>

<p>He went back to his desk before the captain had left the room,
and bent over his letter, but as the departing footsteps died
away, he sprang up, locked the door, and drawing a slip of
paper from under his blotting pad, held it before him with both
hands and looked down at it with a smile of eager triumph.</p>

<p>It was the forged bill. Without a word or gesture he looked
at it for a full minute, gloating over it as if it were some live,
sentient thing lying in his path and utterly at his mercy; then
at last he raised his head, and his lips parted with a smile of
conscious power.</p>

<p>"So soon!" he muttered; "so soon! Fate is with me! She
is mine! My beautiful Stella! Yes, she is mine, though a
hundred Lord Leycesters stood between us!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Stella awoke in the morning it was with a start that
she remembered the scene of last night, and that she was, with
the exception of Mrs. Penfold, alone in the cottage.</p>

<p>While she was dressing she recalled the incidents of the eventful
evening&mdash;the party at the Hall, the telegram, and, not least,
the finding of the mysterious miniature. But, above all, there
shone out clear and distinct the all-important fact that Lord
Leycester loved her, and that she had promised to meet him this
evening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>But for the present there was much on her mind. She had to
meet Mrs. Penfold, and communicate the information that Mr.
Etheridge had suddenly been called to London on important
business.</p>

<p>She could not suppress a smile as she pictured Mrs. Penfold's
astonishment and curiosity, and wondered how she should satisfy
the latter without betraying the small amount of confidence
which her uncle had placed in her.</p>

<p>She went down-stairs to find the breakfast laid, and Mrs.
Penfold hovering about with unconcealed impatience.</p>

<p>"Where's your uncle, Miss Stella?" she asked. "I do hope
he hasn't gone sketching before breakfast, for he is sure to forget
all about it, and won't come back till dinner-time, if he does
then."</p>

<p>"Uncle has gone to London," said Stella.</p>

<p>"To&mdash;where?" demanded Mrs. Penfold.</p>

<p>Then Stella explained.</p>

<p>"Gone to London last night; hasn't slept in his bed! Why,
miss, how could you let him?"</p>

<p>"But he was obliged to go," said Stella, with a little sigh and
a rueful glance at the empty chair opposite her own.</p>

<p>"Obliged!" exclaimed Mrs. Penfold. "Whatever was the
matter? Your uncle isn't obliged to go anywhere, Miss Stella!"
she added with a touch of pride.</p>

<p>Stella shook her head.</p>

<p>"There was a telegram," she said. "I don't know what the
business was, but he was obliged to go."</p>

<p>Mrs. Penfold stood stock-still in dismay and astonishment.</p>

<p>"It will be the death of him!" she breathed, awe-struck.
"He never goes anywhere any distance, and starting off like
that, Miss Stella, in the dead of night, and after being out at the
Hall&mdash;why it's enough to kill a gentleman like him who can't
bear any noise or anything sudden like."</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry," said Stella. "He said that he was obliged
to go."</p>

<p>"And when is he coming back?" asked Mrs. Penfold.</p>

<p>Stella shook her head.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I hope to-day&mdash;I do hope to-day! It all
seems so quiet and lonely without him." And she looked round
the room, and sighed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Penfold stood, with the waiter in her hand, staring at
the beautiful face.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you don't know what it is, Miss Stella?" she asked, in
a low voice, and with a certain significance in her tone.</p>

<p>Stella looked up at her.</p>

<p>"No, I don't know&mdash;uncle did not tell me," she replied.</p>

<p>Mrs. Penfold looked at her curiously, and seemed lost in
thought.</p>

<p>"And you don't know where he's gone, Miss Stella? I don't
ask out of curiosity."</p>

<p>"I'm sure of that," said Stella, warmly. "No, I don't know."</p>

<p>"And you don't guess?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>Stella looked up at her with wide open eyes, and shook her
head.</p>

<p>Mrs. Penfold turned the waiter in her hand, then she said suddenly:</p>

<p>"I wish Mr. Adelstone was here."</p>

<p>Stella started.</p>

<p>"Mr. Adelstone!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Penfold nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss Stella. He is such a clever young gentleman, and
he's so friendly, he'd do anything for your uncle. He always
was friendly, but he's more so than ever now."</p>

<p>"Is he?" said Stella. "Why?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Penfold looked at her with a smile, which died away before
Stella's look of unconsciousness.</p>

<p>"I don't know, Miss Stella; but he is. He is always about
the cottage. Oh, I forgot! he called yesterday, and left something
for you."</p>

<p>And she went out, returning presently with a bouquet of flowers.</p>

<p>"I took them in the pantry, to keep cool and fresh. Aren't
they beautiful, miss?"</p>

<p>"Very," said Stella, smelling them and holding them a little
way from her, after the manner of her sex. "Very beautiful. It is
very kind of him. Are they for uncle, or for me?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Penfold smiled.</p>

<p>"For you, Miss Stella. Is it likely he'd leave them for your
uncle?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Stella; "he is uncle's friend, not mine.
Will you put them in water, please?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Penfold took them with a little air of disappointment. It
was not in this cool manner that she expected Stella to receive
the flowers.</p>

<p>"Yes, miss; and there's nothing to be done?"</p>

<p>"No," said Stella; "except to wait for my uncle's return."</p>

<p>Mrs. Penfold hesitated a moment, then she went out.</p>

<p>Stella made an effort to eat some breakfast, but it was a failure;
she felt restless and listless; a spell seemed to have been
cast over the little house&mdash;a spell of mystery and secrecy.</p>

<p>After breakfast she took up her hat and wandered about the
garden, communing with herself, and ever watching the path
across the meadows, though she knew that her uncle could not
possibly return yet.</p>

<p>The day wore away and the evening came, and as the daylight
gave place to sunset, Stella's heart beat faster. All day
she had been thinking&mdash;dreaming of the hour that was now so
near at hand, longing for and yet almost dreading it. This love
was so strange, so mysterious a thing, that it almost frightened
her.</p>

<p>Almost for the first time she asked herself whether she was
not doing wrong&mdash;whether she had not better stay at home and
give up this precious meeting.</p>

<p>But she mentally pictured Lord Leycester's waiting for her&mdash;mentally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
called up the tone of his voice welcoming her, and her
conscience was stilled.</p>

<p>"I must go!" she murmured, and as if afraid lest she should
change her mind, she put on her hat, and went down the path
with a quick step. But she turned back at the gate, and called
to Mrs. Penfold.</p>

<p>"I am going for a stroll," she said, with a sudden blush. "If
uncle returns while I am away, tell him I shall not be long."</p>

<p>And then she went across the meadows to the river bank.</p>

<p>All was silent save the thrushes in the woods and the nightingale
with its long liquid note and short "jug, jug," and she sank
down upon the grassy bank and waited.</p>

<p>The clock struck the hour of appointment, and her heart beat
fast.</p>

<p>Suppose he did not come! Her cheek paled, and a faint sickening
feeling of disappointment crept over her. The minutes
passed, hours they seemed, and then with a sudden resolution she
rose.</p>

<p>"He will not come," she murmured. "I will go back; it is
better so!"</p>

<p>But even as the words left her lips sadly, a light skiff shot
from the shadow of the opposite bank and flew across the river.</p>

<p>It was Lord Leycester, she knew him though his back was
turned toward her and he was dressed in a suit of boating
flannel, and her heart leapt.</p>

<p>With practiced ease he brought the skiff alongside the bank
and sprang up beside her, both hands outstretched.</p>

<p>"My darling!" he murmured, his eyes shining with a greeting
as passionate as his words&mdash;"have you been waiting long?
Did you think I was not coming?"</p>

<p>Stella put her hands in his and glanced up at him for a
moment; her face flushed, then paled.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;did not know," she said, shyly, but with a little smile
lurking in the corner of her red lips.</p>

<p>"You knew I should come," he went on. "What should,
what could, prevent me? Stella! I was here before you. I have
been lying under that tree, watching you; you looked so beautiful
that I lay there feasting my eyes, and reluctant to move lest
I should dispel the beautiful vision."</p>

<p>Stella looked across and her eyes drooped.</p>

<p>"You where there while I&mdash;I was thinking that you had perhaps&mdash;forgotten!"</p>

<p>"Forgotten!" and he laughed softly. "I have been looking
forward to this hour; I dreamt of it last night. Can you say
the same, Stella?"</p>

<p>She was silent for a moment, then she looked up at him shyly,
as a soft "Yes" dropped from her lips.</p>

<p>He would have drawn her close to him, but she shrank back
with a little frightened gesture.</p>

<p>"Come," he said, and he drew her gently toward the boat.</p>

<p>Stella hesitated.</p>

<p>"Suppose," she said, "someone saw us," and the color flew to
her face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>"And if!" he retorted, with a sudden look of defiance, which
melted in a moment. "There is no fear of that, my darling; we
will go down the back water. Come."</p>

<p>There was no resisting that low-voiced mingling of entreaty
and loving command. With the tenderest care he helped her
into the boat and arranged the cushion for her.</p>

<p>"See," he said, "if we meet any boat you must put up your
sunshade, but we shall not where we are going."</p>

<p>Stella leant back and watched him under her lowered lids as
he rowed&mdash;every stroke of the strong arm sending the boat along
like an arrow from the bow&mdash;and an exquisite happiness fell
upon her. She did not want him to speak; it was enough for
her to sit and watch him, to know that he was within reach of
her hand if she bent forward, to feel that he loved her.</p>

<p>He rowed down stream until they came to an island; then he
guided the boat out of the principal current into a back water,
and rested on his oars.</p>

<p>"Now let me look at you!" he said. "I haven't had an opportunity
yet."</p>

<p>Stella put up her sunshade to shield her face, and laughingly
he drew it away.</p>

<p>"That is not fair. I have been thirsting for a glance from
those dark eyes all day. I cannot have them hidden now. And
what are you thinking of?" he asked, smilingly, but with suppressed
eagerness, "There is a serious little look in those eyes
of yours&mdash;of mine! They are mine, are they not, Stella? What
is it?"</p>

<p>"Shall I tell you?" she answered, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "You shall whisper it. Let me come nearer
to you," and he sank down at her feet and put up his hand for
hers. "Now then."</p>

<p>Stella hesitated a moment.</p>

<p>"I was thinking and wondering whether this&mdash;whether this
isn't very wrong, Le&mdash;Leycester."</p>

<p>The name dropped almost inaudibly, but he heard it and put
her hand to his lips.</p>

<p>"Wrong?" he said, as if he were weighing the question most
judiciously. "Yes and no. Yes, if we do not love each other,
we two. No, if we do. I can speak for myself, Stella. My
conscience is at rest because I love you. And you?"</p>

<p>Her hand closed in his.</p>

<p>"No, my darling," he said, "I would not ask you to do anything
wrong. It may be a little unconventional, this stolen half-hour
of ours&mdash;perhaps it is; but what do you and I care for the
conventional? It is our happiness we care for," and he smiled
up at her.</p>

<p>It was a dangerously subtle argument for a girl of nineteen,
and coming from the man she loved, but it sufficed for Stella,
who scarcely knew the full meaning of the term "conventional,"
but, nevertheless, she looked down at him with a serious light
in her eye.</p>

<p>"I wonder if Lady Lenore would have done it," she said.</p>

<p>A cloud like a summer fleece swept across his face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>"Lenore?" he said, then he laughed. "Lenore and you are
two very different persons, thank Heaven. Lenore," and he
laughed, "worships the conventional! She would not move a
step in any direction excepting that properly mapped out by
Mrs. Grundy."</p>

<p>"You would not ask her, then?" said Stella.</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>"No, I should not," he said, emphatically and significantly.
"I should not ask anyone but you, my darling. Would you
wish me to?"</p>

<p>"No, no," she said hastily, and she laughed.</p>

<p>"Then let us be happy," he said, caressing her hand. "Do
you know that you have made a conquest&mdash;I mean in addition
to myself?"</p>

<p>"No," she said. "I?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you," he repeated. "I mean my sister Lilian."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Stella, with a little glad light in her eyes. "How
beautiful and lovable she is!"</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes, and she has fallen in love with you. We are very much
alike in our tastes," he said, with a significant smile. "Yes,
she thinks <i>you</i> beautiful and lovable."</p>

<p>Stella looked down at the ardent face, so handsome in its passionate
eagerness.</p>

<p>"Did you&mdash;did you tell her?" she murmured.</p>

<p>He understood what she meant, and shook his head.</p>

<p>"No; it was to be a secret&mdash;our secret for the present, my
darling. I did not tell her."</p>

<p>"She would be sorry," said Stella. "They would all be sorry,
would they not?" she added, sadly.</p>

<p>"Why should you think of that?" he expostulated, gently.
"What does it matter? All will come right in the end. They
will not be sorry when you are my wife. When is it to be,
Stella?" and his voice grew thrillingly soft.</p>

<p>Stella started, and a scarlet blush flushed her face.</p>

<p>"Ah, no!" she said, almost pantingly, "not for very, very
long&mdash;perhaps never!"</p>

<p>"It must be very soon," he murmured, putting his arm around
her. "I could not wait long! I could not endure existence if
we should chance to be parted. Stella, I never knew what love
meant until now! If you knew how I have waited for this
meeting of ours, how the weary hours have hung with leaden
weight upon my hands, how miserably dull the day seemed, you
would understand."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I do," she said softly, and the dark eyes dwelt upon
his musingly as she recalled her own listlessness and impatience.</p>

<p>"Then you must think as I do!" he said, quick to take advantage.
"Say you do, Stella! Think how very happy we
should be."</p>

<p>She did think, and the thought made her tremble with excess
of joy.</p>

<p>"We two together in the world! Where we would go and
what we would do! We could go to all the beautiful places&mdash;your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
own Italy, Switzerland! and always together&mdash;think of it."</p>

<p>"I am thinking," she said with a smile.</p>

<p>He drew closer and put her arm around his neck. The very
innocence and purity of her love inflamed his passion and enhanced
her charms in his sight.</p>

<p>He had been loved before, but never like this, with such perfect,
unquestioning love.</p>

<p>"Well, then, my darling, why should we wait? It must be
soon, Stella."</p>

<p>"No, no," she said, faintly. "Why should it? I&mdash;I am very
happy."</p>

<p>"What is it you dread? Is it so dreadful the thought that we
should be alone together&mdash;all in all to each other?"</p>

<p>"It is not that," said Stella, her eyes fixed on the line of light
that fell on the water from the rising moon. "It is not that. I
am thinking of others."</p>

<p>"Always of others!" he said, with tender reproach. "Think
of me&mdash;of ourselves."</p>

<p>"I wish&mdash;&mdash;" she said.</p>

<p>"Wish," he coaxed her. "See if I cannot gratify it. I will,
if it be possible."</p>

<p>"It is not possible," she said. "I was going to say that I wish
you were not&mdash;what you are."</p>

<p>"You said something like that last night," he said. "Darling,
I have wished it often. You wish that I were plain Mr. Brown."</p>

<p>"No, no," she said, with a smile; "not that."</p>

<p>"That I were a Mr. Wyndward&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"With no castle," she broke in. "Ah, if that could be! If
you were only, say, a workman! How good that would be!
Think! you would live in a little cottage, and you would go to
work, and come home at night, and I should be waiting for you
with your tea&mdash;do they have tea or dinner?" she broke off to inquire,
with a laugh.</p>

<p>"You see," he said, returning her laugh, "it would not do.
Why, Stella, you were not made for a workman's wife; the sordid
cares of poverty are for different natures to yours. And yet
we should be happy, we two." And he sighed wistfully. "You
would be glad to see me come home, Stella?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, half seriously, half archly. "I have seen
them in Italy, the peasants' wives, standing at the cottage doors,
the hot sunset lighting up their faces and their colored kerchiefs,
waiting for their husbands, and watching them as they climbed
the hills from the pastures and the vineyards, and they have
looked so happy that I&mdash;I have envied them. I was not happy
in Italy, you know."</p>

<p>"My Stella!" he murmured. His love for her was so deep and
passionate, his sympathy so keen that half phrases were as
plainly understood by him as if she had spoken for hours. "And
so you would wait for me at some cottage door?" he said. "Well,
it shall be so. I will leave England, if you like&mdash;leave the castle
and take some little ivy-green cottage."</p>

<p>She smiled, and shook her head.</p>

<p>"Then they would have reason to complain," she said; "they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
would say 'she has dragged him down to her level&mdash;she has
taught him to forget all the duties of his rank and high position&mdash;she
has'&mdash;what is it Tennyson says&mdash;'robbed him of all the
uses of life, and left him worthless.'"</p>

<p>Lord Leycester looked up at the exquisite face with a new
light of admiration.</p>

<p>This was no mere pretty doll, no mere bread-and-butter school-girl
to whom he had given his love, but a girl who thought, and
who could express her thoughts.</p>

<p>"Stella!" he murmured, "you almost frighten me with your
wisdom. Where did you learn such experience? Well, it is not
to be a cottage, then; and I am not to work in the fields or tend
the sheep. What then remains? Nothing, save that you take
your proper place in the world as my wife;" the indescribable
tenderness with which he whispered the last word brought the
warm blood to her face. "Where should I find a lovelier face
to add to the line of portraits in the old hall? Where should I
find a more graceful form to stand by my side and welcome my
guests? Where a more 'gracious ladye' than the maiden I love?"</p>

<p>"Oh, hush! hush!" whispered Stella, her heart beating beneath
the exquisite pleasure of his words, and the gently passionate
voice in which they were spoken. "I am nothing but a simple,
stupid girl, who knows nothing except&mdash;&mdash;" she stopped.</p>

<p>"Except!" he pressed her.</p>

<p>She looked at the water a moment, then she bent down, and
lightly touched his hand with her lips.</p>

<p>"Except that she loves you!"</p>

<p>It was all summed up in this. He did not attempt to return
the caress; he took it reverentially, half overwhelmed with it.
It was as if a sudden stillness had fallen on nature, as if the
night stood still in awe of her great happiness.</p>

<p>They were silent for a minute, both wrapped in thoughts of
the other, then Stella said suddenly, and with a little
not-to-be-suppressed sigh:</p>

<p>"I must go! See, the moon is almost above the trees."</p>

<p>"It rises early to-night, very," he said, eagerly.</p>

<p>"But I must go," she said.</p>

<p>"Wait a moment," he pleaded. "Let us go on shore and
walk to the weir&mdash;only to the weir; then we will come back
and I will row you over. It will not take five minutes! Come,
I want to show it to you with the moon on it. It is a favorite
spot of mine; I have often stood and watched it as the water
danced over it in the moonlight. I want to do so this evening,
with you by my side. I am selfish, am I not?"</p>

<p>He helped her out of the boat, almost taking her in his arms,
and touching her sleeve with his lips; in his chivalrous mood he
would not so far take advantage of her in her helplessness as to
kiss her face, and they walked hand in hand, as they used to do
in the good old days when men and women were not ashamed
of love.</p>

<p>Why is it that they should be now? Why is it that when a
pair of lovers indulge on the stage in the most chaste of embraces,
a snigger and a grin run through the audience? In this age of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
burlesque and satire, of sarcasm and cynicism, is there to be no
love making? If so, what are poets and novelists to write
about&mdash;the electric light and the science of astronomy?</p>

<p>They walked hand in hand, Leycester Wyndward Viscount
Trevor, heir to Wyndward and an earldom, and Stella, the
painter's niece, and threaded the wood, keeping well under the
shadows of the high trees, until they reached the bank where the
weir touched.</p>

<p>Lord Leycester took her to the brink and held her lightly.</p>

<p>"See," he said, pointing to the silver stream of water; "isn't
that beautiful; but it is not for its beauty only that I have
brought you to the river. Stella, I want you to plight your troth
to me here."</p>

<p>"Here?" she said, looking up at his eager face.</p>

<p>"Yes; this spot is reported haunted&mdash;haunted by good fairies
instead of evil spirits. We will ask them to smile on our betrothal,
Stella."</p>

<p>She smiled, and watched his eyes with half-serious amusement;
there was a strange light of earnestness in them.</p>

<p>Stooping down he took up a handful of the foaming water
and threw a few drops on her head and a few on his own.</p>

<p>"That is the old Danish rite, Stella," he said. "Now repeat
after me&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Come joy or woe, come pain or pleasure,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Come poverty or richest treasure,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I cling to thee, love, heart unto heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Till death us sever, we will not part.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Stella repeated the words after him with a faint smile on her
lips, which died away under the glow of his earnest eyes.</p>

<p>Then, as the last words dropt hurriedly from her lips, he took
her in his arms and kissed her.</p>

<p>"Now we are betrothed, Stella, you and I against all the
world."</p>

<p>As he spoke a cloud sailed across the moon, and the shadows
now at their feet suddenly changed from silver to dullish lead.</p>

<p>Stella shuddered in his arms, and clung to him with a little
convulsive movement that thrilled him.</p>

<p>"Let us go," she said; "let us go. It seems almost as if there
were spirits here! How dark it is!"</p>

<p>"Only for a moment, darling!" he said. "See?" and he took
her face and turned it to the moonlight again. "One kiss, and
we will go."</p>

<p>With no blush on her face, but with a glow of passionate love
in her eyes, she raised her face, looked into his for a moment,
then kissed him.</p>

<p>Then they turned, and went toward the boat; but this time she
clung to his arm, and her head nestled on his shoulder. As they
turned, something white and ghost-like moved from behind the
trees, in front of which they had been standing.</p>

<p>It stood in the moonlight looking after them, itself so white
and eerie that it might have been one of the good fairies; but that
in its face&mdash;beautiful enough for any fairy&mdash;there glittered the
white, angry, threatening look of an evil spirit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>Was it the nearness of this exquisitely-graceful figure in
white which by some instinct Stella had felt and been alarmed at?</p>

<p>The figure watched them for a moment until they were out
of sight, then it turned and struck into a path leading toward
the Hall.</p>

<p>As it did so, another figure&mdash;a black one this time&mdash;came out
of the shadow, and crossed the path obliquely.</p>

<p>She turned and saw a white, not unhandsome, face, with
small keen eyes bent on her. She, the watcher, had been
watched.</p>

<p>For a moment she stood as if half-tempted to speak, but the
next drew the fleecy shawl round her head with a gesture of almost
insolent hauteur.</p>

<p>But she was not to escape so easily; the dark, thin figure slipped
back, and stooping down picked up the handkerchief, which
in her sweeping gesture she had let drop.</p>

<p>"Pardon!" he said.</p>

<p>She looked at him with cool disdain, then took the handkerchief,
and with an inclination of her head that was scarcely a
bow would have passed on again, but he did not move from her
path, and hat in hand stood looking at her.</p>

<p>Proud, fearless, imperiously haughty as she was, she felt constrained
to stop.</p>

<p>He knew by the mere fact of her stopping that he had impressed
her, and he at once followed up the advantage gained.</p>

<p>If she had wanted to pass him without speaking she should
have taken no notice of the handkerchief, and gone on her way.
No doubt she now wished that she had done so, but it was too
late now.</p>

<p>"Will you permit me to speak to you?" he said, in a quiet,
almost a constrained voice, every word distinct, every word full
of significance.</p>

<p>She looked at him, at the pale face with its thin, resolute lips
and small, keen eyes, and inclined her head.</p>

<p>"If you intend to speak to me, sir, I apprehend that I cannot
prevent it. You will do well to remember that we are not alone
here."</p>

<p>Still uncovered, he bowed.</p>

<p>"Your ladyship has no need to remind me of that fact. No
deed or word of mine will cause you to wish for a protector."</p>

<p>"I have yet to learn that," she said. "You appear to know
me, sir!"</p>

<p>No words will convey any idea of the haughty scorn expressed
by the icy tone and the cold glance of the violet eyes.</p>

<p>A faint smile, deferential yet self-possessed, swept across his
face.</p>

<p>"There are some so well known to the world that their faces
are easily recognized even in the moonlight; such an one is the
Lady Len&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She put up her hand, white and glittering with priceless gems,
and at the commanding gesture he stopped, but the smile swept
across his face again, and he put up his hand to his lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>"You know my name; you wish to speak to me?"</p>

<p>He inclined his head.</p>

<p>"What have you to say to me?"</p>

<p>She had not asked his name; she had treated him as if he
were some beggar who had crept up to her carriage as it stood
at rest, and by a mixture of bravado and servility gained her
ear. There was a fierce, passionate resentment at this treatment
burning in his bosom, but he kept it down.</p>

<p>"Is it some favor you have to ask?" she said, with cold, pitiless
hauteur, seeing that he hesitated.</p>

<p>"Thanks," he said. "I was waiting for a suggestion&mdash;I
must put it in that way. Yes, I have to ask a favor. My lady,
I am a stranger to you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She waved her hand as if she did not care so much as a withered
blade of grass for his personal history, and with a little
twitch of the lips he continued:</p>

<p>"I am a stranger to you, but I still venture to ask your assistance."</p>

<p>She looked and smiled like one who has known all along what
was coming, but to please his own whim, had waited quite naturally.</p>

<p>"Exactly," she said. "I have no money&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then he started and stood before her, and what there was of
manliness awoke within him.</p>

<p>"Money!" he said. "Are you mad?"</p>

<p>Lady Lenore stared at him haughtily.</p>

<p>"I fear that you are," she said. "Did you not demand&mdash;<i>ask</i>
is too commonplace a word to describe a request made by a man
of a woman alone and unprotected&mdash;did you not demand money,
sir?"</p>

<p>"Money!" he repeated; then he smiled. "You are laboring
under a misapprehension," he said. "I am in no need of
money. The assistance I need is not of a pecuniary kind."</p>

<p>"Then what is it?" she asked, and he detected a touch of curiosity
in the insolently-haughty voice. "Be good enough to
state your desire as briefly as you can, sir, and permit me to go
on my way."</p>

<p>Then he played a card.</p>

<p>With a low bow he raised his hat, and drew from the path.</p>

<p>"I beg your ladyship's pardon," he said, respectfully, but with
a scarcely feigned air of disappointment. "I see that I have
made a mistake. I apologize most humbly for having intruded
upon your good nature, and I take my leave. I wish your ladyship
good-evening," and he turned.</p>

<p>Lady Lenore looked after him with cold disdain, then she bit
her lip and her eyes dropped, and suddenly, without raising her
voice, she said:</p>

<p>"Wait!"</p>

<p>He turned and stood with his hand thrust in the breast of his
coat, his face calm and self-possessed.</p>

<p>She paused a moment and eyed him, struggling, if the truth
were known, and no doubt he knew it, with her curiosity and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
her pride, which last forbade her hold any further converse with
him. At last curiosity conquered.</p>

<p>"I have called you back, sir, to ask the nature of this mistake
you say that you have made. Your conduct, your manner,
your words are inexplicable to me. Be good enough to explain."</p>

<p>It was a command, and he inclined his head in respectful
recognition.</p>

<p>"I am a student of nature, my lady," he said, in a low voice,
"and I am fond of rambling in the woods here, especially at
moonlight; it is not a singular fancy."</p>

<p>Her face did not flush, but her eyes gleamed; she saw the
sneer in the words.</p>

<p>"Go on, sir," she said, coldly.</p>

<p>"Chance led me to-night in the direction of the river. I was
standing admiring it when two individuals&mdash;the two individuals
who have just left us&mdash;approached. Suspecting a love tryst, I
was retreating, when the moon revealed to me that one of the
individuals was a person in whom I take a great interest."</p>

<p>"Which?" she asked, coldly and calmly.</p>

<p>"The young lady," he replied, and his eyes drooped for a
moment.</p>

<p>"That interest rather than curiosity,"&mdash;her lips curled, and
she looked up at him with infinite scorn&mdash;"interest rather than
curiosity prompted me to remain and, an unwilling listener, I
heard the strange engagement&mdash;betrothal, call it what you will&mdash;that
took place."</p>

<p>He paused. She drew the shawl round her head and eyed him
askance.</p>

<p>"In what way does this concern me, sir?" she demanded,
haughtily.</p>

<p>"Pardon! you perceive my mistake," he said, with a fitting
smile. "I was under the impression that as <i>interest</i> or <i>curiosity</i>
prompted you also to listen, you might be pleased to assist me."</p>

<p>She bit her lip now.</p>

<p>"How did you know that I was listening?" she demanded.</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>"I saw your ladyship approach; I saw you take up your position
behind the tree, and <i>I saw your face as they talked</i>."</p>

<p>As she remembered all that that face must have told him, her
heart throbbed with a wild longing to see him helpless at her
feet; her face went a blood red, and her hands closed tightly on
the shawl.</p>

<p>"Well, sir?" she said at last, after a pause, during which he
had stood eying her under his lowered lids. "Granting that
you are right in your surmises, how can I assist you, supposing
that I choose to do so?"</p>

<p>He looked at her full in the face.</p>

<p>"By helping me to prevent the fulfillment of the engagement&mdash;betrothal,
which you and I have just witnessed," he said,
promptly and frankly.</p>

<p>She was silent a moment, her eyes looking beyond him as if
she were considering, then she said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why should I help you? How do you know that I take any
interest in&mdash;in these two persons?"</p>

<p>"You forget," he said, softly. "I saw your face."</p>

<p>She started. There was something in the bold audacity of the
man that proved him the master.</p>

<p>"If I admit that I do take some interest, what proof have I
that I shall be following that interest by confiding in you?" she
asked, haughtily, but less haughtily than hitherto.</p>

<p>"I can give you a sufficient proof," he said, quietly. "I&mdash;love&mdash;her."</p>

<p>She started. There was so calm and cool and yet intense an
expression in his voice.</p>

<p>"You love her?" she repeated. "The girl who has just left
us?"</p>

<p>"The young lady," he said, with a slight emphasis, "who has
just plighted her troth to Lord Leycester Wyndward."</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment. His direct statement of the
case had told on her.</p>

<p>"And if I help you&mdash;if I consent&mdash;what shape is my assistance
to take?"</p>

<p>"I leave that to you," he said. "I can answer for her, for
Stella Etheridge&mdash;that is her name."</p>

<p>"I do not wish to mention names," she said, coldly.</p>

<p>"Quite right," he said. "Trees have ears, as you and I have
just proved."</p>

<p>She shuddered at the familiar, confident tone in his voice.</p>

<p>"I will not mention names," he repeated, "let us say 'him'
and 'her.' Candidly&mdash;and between us, my lady, there should be
nothing but candor&mdash;I have sworn that nothing shall come of
this betrothal. I love her, and&mdash;I&mdash;hate him."</p>

<p>She looked at him. His face was deadly white, and his eyes
gleamed, but a smile still played about his lips.</p>

<p>"You," he continued, "hate her, and&mdash;love&mdash;him."</p>

<p>Lady Lenore started, and a crimson flush of shame stained her
fair face.</p>

<p>"How dare you!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>"I have shown you my hand, my lady; I know yours. Will
you tell me that I am wrong? Say the word&mdash;say that you are
indifferent how matters go&mdash;and I will make my bow and leave
you."</p>

<p>She stood and looked at him&mdash;she could not say the word.
He had spoken the truth; she did love Lord Leycester with a
passion that surprised her, with a passion that had not made itself
known to her until to-night, when she had seen him take
into his arms another woman&mdash;had heard his protestations of
love for another woman, and seen him kiss another woman.</p>

<p>Wounded pride, self-love, passionate desire, all fought for
mastery within her bosom, and the man who stood calmly before
her knew it.</p>

<p>He read every thought of her heart as it was mirrored on the
proud, beautiful face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do not understand," she said. "You come to me a perfect
stranger, and make these confessions."</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>"I come to you because you and I desire to accomplish one end&mdash;the
separation of these two persons. I come to you because I
have already found some means toward such an end, and I believe
you are capable of devising and carrying out the remainder.
Lady Lenore&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do not utter my name," she said, looking round uneasily.</p>

<p>"&mdash;You, and you alone, can help me. As I have said, I can
influence the girl, you can influence him. I have worked hard
for that influence&mdash;have plotted, and planned, and schemed
for it. Cleverness, ingenuity&mdash;call it what you will&mdash;has been
exerted by me; you have only to exert your&mdash;pardon me&mdash;your
beauty."</p>

<p>With a gesture, she drew the shawl nearer her face&mdash;it was
like profanation to hear him speak of her beauty.</p>

<p>"&mdash;Together we conquer; alone, I think, we should fail, for
though I hold her in a cleft stick I cannot answer for him. He
is headstrong and wild, and in a moment might upset my plans.
Your task&mdash;if you accept it&mdash;is to see that he does not. Will you
accept it?"</p>

<p>She paused.</p>

<p>"What is your hold over her?" she asked, curiously.</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>"Pardon me if I decline to answer. Be assured that I have a
hold upon her. Your hold on him is as strong as that of mine
on her. Will you exert it?"</p>

<p>She was silent.</p>

<p>"Think," he said. "Let me put the case clearly. For his
own good you ought not to hesitate. What good can come of
such a marriage&mdash;a viscount, an earl, marry the niece of a
painter, an obscure nobody! It is for his own good&mdash;the husband
of Stella&mdash;I forgot!&mdash;no names. As her husband he sinks
into insignificance, as yours he rises to the height which his
position and yours entitle him to. Can you hesitate?"</p>

<p>No tempter since the world began, not even the serpent at the
foot of the apple-tree in Eden, could have put it more ingeniously.
She wavered. Reluctant to make a compact with a man and
a stranger, and such a man! She stood and hesitated.</p>

<p>He drew out his watch.</p>

<p>"It is getting late," he said. "I see your ladyship declines
the alliance I offer you. I wish you 'good-night,'" and he
raised his hat.</p>

<p>She put forth her hand; it was as white as her face.</p>

<p>"Stop," she said, "I agree."</p>

<p>"Good," he said, with a smile. "Give me your hand," and
he held out his.</p>

<p>She hesitated, but she put her hand in his; the mental strength
of the man overcame her repugnance.</p>

<p>"So we seal our bargain. All I ask your ladyship to do is to
watch, and to strike when the iron is hot. When that time
comes I will give you warning."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>And his hand closed over hers.</p>

<p>A shudder ran through her at the contact; his hand was cold
as ice.</p>

<p>"There is no chance that these two will keep their compact
now," he said; "you and I will prevent it. Good-night, my
lady."</p>

<p>"Stop!" she said, and he turned. "You have not told me
your name&mdash;you know mine."</p>

<p>He smiled at her&mdash;a smile of victory and self-confidence.</p>

<p>"My name is Jasper Adelstone," he said.</p>

<p>Her lips repeated the name.</p>

<p>"Shall I see you safely into the hall?"</p>

<p>"No, no," she said. "Go, if you please."</p>

<p>He inclined his head and left her, but he did not go until she
had entered the private park by another gate, and her figure
was lost to sight.</p>

<p>Lord Leycester rowed Stella across the river, and parted from
her.</p>

<p>"Good-night, my beloved," he whispered. "It is not for long.
I shall see you to-morrow. Good-night! I shall wait here until
I see you enter the lane; you will be safe then."</p>

<p>He held her in his arms for a moment, then he let her go, and
stood on the bank watching her.</p>

<p>She sped across the meadows and entered the lane breathless.</p>

<p>Pausing for a moment to recover her composure, she went on
to the gate and opened it.</p>

<p>As she did so a slight, youthful figure slipped out of the shadow
and confronted her.</p>

<p>She uttered a slight cry and looked up.</p>

<p>At that moment the moonlight fell upon the face in front of
her.</p>

<p>It was the same face in the miniature. The same face, though
changed from boyhood to youth.</p>

<p>It was "Frank!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was the face she had seen in the miniature, changed from
childhood to youth. The same blue eyes, frank, confiding,
and womanish&mdash;the same golden hair clustering in short curls,
instead of falling on the shoulders as in the picture&mdash;the same
smiling mouth, with its little touch of weakness about the under
lip. A taking, a pretty rather than a handsome face; it ought to
have belonged rather to a girl than a boy.</p>

<p>Stella stared, and doubted the evidence of her senses. Her
dream flashed across her mind and made her heart beat
with a sudden emotion, whether of fear or pleasure she could
not tell.</p>

<p>Who was this boy, and what was he doing there leaning on
the gate as if the place belonged to him, and he had a right to be
there?</p>

<p>She took a step nearer, and he opened the gate for her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Stella entered, and he raised his hat, allowing the moonbeams
to fall on his yellow hair, and smiled at her, very much as a
child might smile, with grave, open-eyed admiration and greeting.</p>

<p>"Are you&mdash;you <i>are</i> Stella!" he said, in a voice that made her
start,&mdash;it was so like her uncle's, but softer and brighter.</p>

<p>"My name is Stella!" she said, filled with wonder.</p>

<p>He held out his hand frankly, but with a little timid shyness.</p>

<p>"Then we are cousins," he said.</p>

<p>"Cousins?" exclaimed Stella, but she gave him her hand.</p>

<p>"Yes, cousins," he said. "You are Stella, Uncle Harold's daughter,
are you not? Well, I am Frank."</p>

<p>She had felt it.</p>

<p>"Frank?" she repeated, amazedly.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am your Cousin Frank. I hope"&mdash;and a cloud settled
on his face&mdash;"I hope you are not sorry?"</p>

<p>"Sorry!" she uttered, feeling stupid and confused. "No, I
am not sorry! I am very glad&mdash;of course I am very glad!" and
she held out her hand this time. "But I didn't know!"</p>

<p>"No," he said, with a little sigh. "No, I suppose you did
not."</p>

<p>A step was heard behind them, and Mr. Etheridge appeared.</p>

<p>Stella ran to him with a glad cry and put her arms round his
neck.</p>

<p>"Uncle!"</p>

<p>He kissed her, and parting the hair from her forehead, looked
into her eyes tenderly.</p>

<p>"Yes, Stella, I am back," he said; there was a sad weariness
in his voice, and he looked haggard and tired. "And"&mdash;he
hesitated, and put his hand on the boy's shoulder&mdash;"I have
brought someone with me. This&mdash;is Frank," he hesitated again,
"my son."</p>

<p>Stella suppressed a start, and smiled up at him as if the announcement
were one of the most natural.</p>

<p>"I am so glad," she whispered.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," and his gaze wandered to the face of the boy who
stood looking at them with a little faint smile, half timid, half
uneasy. "Frank has come to stop with us for a time. He is
going to the university."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Stella, again. She felt that there was some mystery,
felt that the boy was connected in some way with that
telegram and the hurried visit to town, and with her characteristic
gentleness and tact hastened to smooth matters. "I'll go
and see if Mrs. Penfold has made proper arrangements," she
said.</p>

<p>Mr. Etheridge looked after her as she went into the house; the
boy's voice startled him.</p>

<p>"How beautiful she is!" he murmured, a faint flush on his
cheek, a light of boyish admiration in his eyes. "I didn't know
I had such a beautiful cousin, so&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," said the old man, warmly. "Go on, Frank. Wait."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>The boy paused and Mr. Etheridge put his hand on his
shoulder.</p>

<p>"She is as good as she is beautiful. She is an angel, Frank.
I need not say that she knows&mdash;nothing."</p>

<p>The boy's face flushed, then went pale, and his eyes drooped.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," he said, gratefully. "No," and he shuddered,
"I wouldn't have her know for&mdash;for the world."</p>

<p>Then he went in. Stella was flitting about the room seeing
the laying of a cloth for an impromptu meal. He paused at the
window as if afraid to approach or disturb her, but she saw him
and came to him with that peculiar little graceful gait which
her uncle had noticed so particularly on the first night of her
coming.</p>

<p>"I am so glad you have come!" she said. "Uncle must be
glad, too!"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, in a low voice. "You are glad, really
glad!"</p>

<p>Her beautiful eyes opened, and she smiled.</p>

<p>"Very glad. You must come in and have some supper. It is
quite ready," and she went and called her uncle.</p>

<p>The old man came in and sat down. The boy waited until she
pointed to a chair, into which he dropped obediently.</p>

<p>Mr. Etheridge offered no explanation of his visit to London,
and she asked for none; but while he sat with his usual silent,
dreamy taciturnity, she talked to him.</p>

<p>Frank sat and listened, scarcely taking his eyes off her.</p>

<p>Presently Mr. Etheridge looked up.</p>

<p>"Where have you been this evening, Stella?" he asked.</p>

<p>A sudden blush covered her face, but though Frank saw it, his
father did not.</p>

<p>"I have been into the woods," she said, "to the river."</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"Very beautiful. The witches' trysting-place, they call it,"
he added, absently.</p>

<p>Stella's face paled, and she hung her head.</p>

<p>"You were rather late, weren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;too late," said Stella, guiltily. If she might only tell
him! "I won't be so late again."</p>

<p>He looked up.</p>

<p>"You will have Frank to keep you company now," he said.</p>

<p>Stella turned to the boy with a smile that was still eloquent of
guilt.</p>

<p>"I shall be very glad," she said, feeling dreadfully deceitful.
"You know all the pretty places, no doubt, and must act as
<i>cicerone</i>."</p>

<p>His eyes dropped.</p>

<p>"No, I don't," he said. "I haven't been here before."</p>

<p>"Frank has been at school," said Mr. Etheridge, quietly.
"You will have to be the <i>cicerone</i>," and he rose and wandered to
the window.</p>

<p>Stella rang the bell, wheeled up the arm-chair, and got the old
man's pipe, hanging over him with marked tenderness, and the
boy watched her with the same intent look.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>Then she came back to her seat, and took out some work.</p>

<p>"You are not going to work to-night?" he said, leaning his
elbows on the table and his head upon his hands&mdash;small, white,
delicate hands, to match the face.</p>

<p>"This is only make-believe," she said. "Don't you know the
old proverb about idle hands?" And she laughed.</p>

<p>He started, and his face paled.</p>

<p>Stella wondered what she had said to affect him, and hurried on.</p>

<p>"I can't sit still and do nothing, can you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, for hours," he said, with a smile; "I am awfully idle,
but I must get better habits; I must follow your example. I
mean to read while I'm down here&mdash;read hard, don't you know.
Shall I begin to-night?" he asked, his eyes upon her with almost
slavish intentness.</p>

<p>"Not to-night," she said, with a laugh; "you must be tired.
You have come from London, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said; "and I am rather tired. I would rather sit
and watch you, if you don't mind."</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"Not in the least. You can tell me about your school."</p>

<p>"I would rather sit and watch you in silence," he said, "unless
you like to talk. I should like that."</p>

<p>He seemed a queer boy; there was something almost sad in his
quietness, but Stella felt that it was only temporary.</p>

<p>"He is tired, poor boy," she thought.</p>

<p>Presently she said:</p>

<p>"How old are you?"</p>

<p>"Seventeen," he said.</p>

<p>She looked at him.</p>

<p>"I did not think you were so old," she said, with a laugh.</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>"Few persons do. Yes; I am seventeen."</p>

<p>"Why, you are quite a man," she said, with a laugh.</p>

<p>He blushed&mdash;proving his boyhood&mdash;and shook his head.</p>

<p>"Stella," came the old man's voice, "will you play something?"</p>

<p>She rose instantly, and glided to the organ and began to play.</p>

<p>She had been playing some little time; then she commenced to
sing.</p>

<p>Suddenly she heard a sound suspiciously like a sob close to her
side, and looking round saw that the boy had stolen to a low
seat near her, and was leaning his face upon his hands. She
stopped, but with a sudden gesture and a look toward her, the
silent, seated figure motioned her to go on.</p>

<p>She finished&mdash;it was the "Ave Maria,"&mdash;and then bent down
to him.</p>

<p>"You are tired!" she whispered.</p>

<p>The voice was so sweet, so kind, so sisterly, that it went
straight to the bottom of the lad's heart.</p>

<p>He looked up at her, with that expression in his eyes which
one sees in the eyes of a faithful, devoted dog then bent and
kissed the sleeve of her dress.</p>

<p>All the tenderness of Stella's nature welled up at the simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
act, and with a little murmur she bent down and put her lips to
his forehead.</p>

<p>His face flushed and he shrank back.</p>

<p>"Don't!" he said, in a strained voice. "I am not worthy!"</p>

<p>For answer she stooped again and kissed him.</p>

<p>He did not shrink this time, but took her hand and held it
with a convulsive grasp, and something trembled on his lip, when
he started and stared toward the window.</p>

<p>Stella turned her head quickly and stared also, for there,
standing with his face turned toward them, with his eyes fixed
on them, stood Jasper Adelstone. She rose, but he came forward
with his finger on his lip.</p>

<p>"He is asleep," he said, glancing at the chair, and he held out
his hand.</p>

<p>Stella took it; it was hot and dry.</p>

<p>"I ought to apologize for coming in so late," he said in a
cautious voice; "but I was passing, and the music proved too
great a temptation. Will you forgive me?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Stella. "We are very glad to see you. This
is my Cousin Frank," she added.</p>

<p>The small eyes that had been fixed on her face turned to the
boy's, and a strange look came into them for a second, then, in his
usual tone, he said:</p>

<p>"Indeed! home for a holiday, I suppose? How do you do?"
and he held out his hand.</p>

<p>Frank came out of the shadow and took it, and Jasper held his
hand and looked at him with a strange smile.</p>

<p>"You have not introduced me," he said to Stella.</p>

<p>Stella smiled.</p>

<p>"This is Mr. Adelstone, a friend of uncle's," she said.</p>

<p>Jasper Adelstone looked at her.</p>

<p>"Will you not say a friend of yours also?" he asked, gently.</p>

<p>Stella laughed.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon; yes, if I may. I'll say a friend of
ours."</p>

<p>"And yours too, I hope," said Jasper Adelstone to Frank.</p>

<p>"Yes, thank you," answered the boy; but there was a strange,
ill-concealed shyness and reluctance in his manner.</p>

<p>Stella drew a chair forward.</p>

<p>"Won't you sit down?" she asked.</p>

<p>He sat down.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I have interrupted you," he said. "Will you
go on&mdash;do, please?"</p>

<p>Stella glanced at her uncle.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I should wake him," she said.</p>

<p>He looked disappointed.</p>

<p>"Some other time," said Stella.</p>

<p>"Thanks," he said.</p>

<p>"Uncle is very tired to-night; he has just come from
London."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said Jasper, with well-feigned surprise. "I have
been to London also. That reminds me, I have ventured to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
bring some music for you&mdash;for your uncle!" and he drew a book
from his pocket.</p>

<p>Stella took it, and uttered a little exclamation of pleasure. It
was a volume of Italian songs; some of them familiar to her,
all of them good.</p>

<p>"How nice, how thoughtful of you!" she said. "Some of
them are old favorites of mine. Uncle will be so pleased.
Thank you very much."</p>

<p>He put his hand to his mouth.</p>

<p>"I am glad there are some songs you like," he said. "I
thought that perhaps you would prefer Italian to English?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes," said Stella, turning over the leaves. "Very much
prefer it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps some night you will allow me to hear some of
them?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, you shall!" she said, lightly.</p>

<p>"I may have an opportunity," he went on, "for I am afraid I
shall be rather a frequent visitor."</p>

<p>"Yes?" said Stella, interrogatively.</p>

<p>"The fact is," he said, hesitatingly, and he could have cursed
himself for his hesitation and awkwardness&mdash;he who was never
awkward or irresolute at other times&mdash;he who had faced the
proud disdain of Lady Lenore and conquered it!&mdash;"the fact is
that I have some business with your uncle. A client of mine is
a patron of the fine arts. He is a very wealthy man, and he is
anxious that Mr. Etheridge, whom he greatly admires, should
paint him a picture on a subject which he has given to me! It
is rather a difficult subject&mdash;I mean it will require some explanation
as the picture progresses, and I have promised, if Mr.
Etheridge will permit me, to give the explanation."</p>

<p>Stella nodded. She had taken up her work again, and bent
over it, quite unconscious of the admiration with which the two
pair of eyes were fixed on her&mdash;the guarded, passionate, wistful,
longing in the man's, the open awe-felt admiration of the boy's.</p>

<p>"But," she said with a smile, "you know how&mdash;I was going
to say obstinate&mdash;my uncle is; do you think he will paint it?"</p>

<p>"I hope to be able to persuade him," he said, with a modest
smile. "Perhaps he will do it for me; I am an old friend, you
know."</p>

<p>"Is it for you, then?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No, no," he said, quickly; "but this art-patron is a great
friend of mine, and I have pledged myself to persuade Mr.
Etheridge."</p>

<p>"I see," said Stella.</p>

<p>Jasper was silent a moment, his eyes wandering round the
room in search of the flowers&mdash;<i>his</i> flowers. They were nowhere
to be seen; but on her bosom were the wild blossoms which
Lord Leycester had gathered.</p>

<p>A dark shade crossed his face for a moment, and his hands
clinched, but he composed himself. The time would come
when she would wear <i>his</i> flowers and his alone&mdash;he had sworn
it!</p>

<p>He turned to Frank with a smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you going to stay at home for long?" he asked.</p>

<p>Frank had withdrawn into the shadow, where he had been
watching Stella and Jasper's faces alternately. He started
visibly.</p>

<p>"I don't know," he said.</p>

<p>"I hope we shall see a great deal of each other," he said. "I
am staying at the Rectory, taking holiday also."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Frank, but not overjoyously.</p>

<p>Jasper rose.</p>

<p>"I must go now," he said, "Good-night." He took Stella's
hand and bent over it; then, turning to the boy, "Good-night.
Yes," he added, and he held the small hands with a tight pressure,
"we must see a good deal of each other, you and I."</p>

<p>Then he stole out noiselessly.</p>

<p>As he disappeared, Frank heaved a sigh of relief, and Stella
looked at him.</p>

<p>He was still standing as he had stood when Jasper held his
hand, looking after him; and there was a strange look on his
face which aroused Stella's attention.</p>

<p>"Well?" she said, with a smile.</p>

<p>Frank started, and looked down at her with a smile.</p>

<p>"Is it true," he asked, "that he is a great friend of my
father's?"</p>

<p>Stella nodded.</p>

<p>"I suppose so, yes."</p>

<p>"And of yours?" he said, intently.</p>

<p>Stella hesitated.</p>

<p>"I have known him such a short time," she said, almost apologetically.</p>

<p>"I thought so," he said. "He is not a friend of yours&mdash;you
don't like him?"</p>

<p>"But"&mdash;said Stella.</p>

<p>"I know it," he said, "as well as if you had told me; and I
am glad of it."</p>

<p>There was a tone of suppressed excitement in his voice&mdash;a restless,
uneasy look in his eyes, which astonished Stella.</p>

<p>"Why?" she said.</p>

<p>"Because," he answered, "I do not like him. I"&mdash;and a
shiver ran through him&mdash;"I hate him."</p>

<p>Stella stared.</p>

<p>"You hate him!" she exclaimed. "You have only seen him
for a few minutes! Ought you to say that?"</p>

<p>"No, I suppose not," he replied; "but I can't help it. I hate
him! There is something about him that&mdash;that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He hesitated.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"That makes me afraid. I felt while he was talking as if I
was being smothered! Don't you know what I mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Stella, quickly.</p>

<p>It was that she had felt herself sometimes, when Jasper's low,
smooth voice was in her ears. But she felt that it was foolish
to encourage the boy's fancy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>"But that is nonsense!" she said. "He is very kind and considerate.
He has sent me some beautiful flowers&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He has?" he said, gloomily.</p>

<p>"And this music."</p>

<p>Frank took up the book and eyed it scornfully, and threw it
on the table as if he were tempted to pitch it out of the window.</p>

<p>"What does he do it for!" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;only out of kindness."</p>

<p>Frank shook his head.</p>

<p>"I don't believe it! I&mdash;I wish he hadn't! I beg your pardon.
Have I offended you?" he added, contritely.</p>

<p>"No," said Stella, laughing. "Not a bit, you foolish boy,"
and she leant on her elbows and looked up at him with her dark
eyes smiling.</p>

<p>He came nearer and looked down at her.</p>

<p>"I am glad you don't like him."</p>

<p>"I didn't say&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I know it. Because I shouldn't like to hate anyone you
liked," he added.</p>

<p>"Then," said Stella, with her rare, musical laugh, "as it's
very wicked to hate anyone, and I ought to help you to be good,
the best thing I can do is to like Mr. Adelstone."</p>

<p>"Heaven forbid!" he said, so earnestly, so passionately, that
Stella started.</p>

<p>"You are a wicked boy!" she said, with a smile.</p>

<p>"I am," he said, gravely, and his lips quivered. "But if anything
could make me better it would be living near you. You
are not offended?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit," laughed Stella; "but I shall be directly, so you
had better go to bed. Your room is quite ready, and you look
tired. Good-night," and she gave him her hand.</p>

<p>He too bent over it, but how differently to Jasper! and he
touched it reverently with his lips.</p>

<p>"Good-night," he said; "say good-night to my father for
me," and he went out.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> hears of the devotion of a dog to its master, the love of a
horse for its rider; such devotion, such love Stella received from
the boy Frank. He was a very singular boy, and strange; he
soon lost the air of melancholy and sadness which hung about
him on the first night of his arrival, and became happier and
sometimes even merry; there was always a certain kind of
reserve about him.</p>

<p>As Stella&mdash;knowing nothing of the history of the forged bill&mdash;said,
he had his thinking fits, when he used to sit with his
head in his hands, his eyes fixed on vacancy.</p>

<p>But these fits were not of frequent occurrence, and oftener he
was in the best of boyish moods, chatty and cheerful, and
"chaffy." His devotion to Stella, indeed, was extraordinary.
It was more than the love of a brother, it was not the love of a
sweetheart, it was a kind of worship. He would sit for hours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
by her side, more often at her feet listening to her singing, or
watching her at work. He was never so happy as when he was
with her, walking in the meadows, and he would gladly lay
aside his fishing rod or his book, to hang about with her in the
garden.</p>

<p>There had never been anyone so beautiful as Stella&mdash;there had
never been anyone so good. The boy looked up to her with the
same admiration and love with which the devotee might regard
his patron saint.</p>

<p>His attachment was so marked that even his father, who
noticed so little, observed it and commented on it.</p>

<p>"Frank follows you like a dog, Stella," he said, the third
evening after the boy's arrival. "Don't let him bother you; he
has his reading to get through, and there's the river and his rod.
Send him about his business if he worries you."</p>

<p>Stella laughed.</p>

<p>"Frank worry me!" she exclaimed lightly. "He is incapable
of such a thing. There never was such a dear considerate boy.
Why, I should miss him dreadfully if he were to go away for an
hour or two even. No, he doesn't bother me in the slightest,
and as to his books and his rod, he shamelessly confessed yesterday,
that he didn't care for any of them half as much as he cared
for me."</p>

<p>The old man looked up and sighed.</p>

<p>"It is strange," he said, "you seem to be the only person who
ever had any influence over him."</p>

<p>"I ought to be very proud, then," said Stella, "and I am. No
one could help loving him, he is so irresistible."</p>

<p>The old man went on with his work with a little sigh.</p>

<p>"Then he's so pretty!" continued Stella. "It is a shame to call
a boy pretty, but that is just what he is."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Etheridge, grimly. "It is the face of a girl,
with all a girl's weakness."</p>

<p>"Hush," said Stella, warningly. "Here he comes. Well,
Frank," she said, as he came in, his slim form dressed in boating
flannels, his rod in his hand. "What have you been doing&mdash;fishing?"</p>

<p>"No," he said, his eyes fixed on her face. "I meant to, but
you said that you would come out directly, and so I waited. Are
you ready? It doesn't matter&mdash;I'll wait. I suppose it's the pudding,
or the custards, or the canary wants feeding. I wish there
were no puddings or canaries."</p>

<p>"What an impatient boy it is," she exclaimed, with a laugh.
"Well, now I'm ready."</p>

<p>"Let's go down to the river," he said. "There's someone fishing
there&mdash;at least, he's supposed to be fishing, but he keeps his
eyes fixed in this direction, so that I don't imagine he is getting
much sport."</p>

<p>"What is he like?" said Stella.</p>

<p>"Like?" said Frank. "Oh, a tall, well-made young fellow, in
brown velvet. A man with a yellow mustache."</p>

<p>Stella's face flushed, and she glanced round at her uncle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let us go," she said. "I know who it is. It is Lord Leycester."</p>

<p>"Not Lord Leycester Wyndward," exclaimed Frank. "Not
really! I should like to see him. Do you know him, Stella?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;a little," said Stella, shyly. "A little."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is Lord Leycester," said Stella, and the color came to
her face.</p>

<p>"I have heard so much about Lord Leycester," said Frank,
eagerly; "everybody knows him in London. He is an awful
swell, isn't he?"</p>

<p>Stella smiled.</p>

<p>"You will teach me the most dreadful slang, Frank," she
said. "Is he such a 'swell,' as you call him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, awful; there isn't anything that he doesn't do. He drives
a coach and four, and he's the owner of two of the best race
horses in England, and he's got a yacht&mdash;the 'Gipsy,' you know&mdash;and,
oh, there's no end to his swelldom. And you know him?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Stella, and her heart smote her, that she could
not say: "I know him so well that I am engaged to be married
to him." But she could not; she had promised, and must keep
her promise.</p>

<p>Frank could not get over his wonder and admiration.</p>

<p>"Why, he's one of the most popular men in London," he said.
"Let me see! there's something else I heard about him. Oh,
yes, he is going to be married."</p>

<p>"Is he?" said Stella, and a little smile came about her lips.</p>

<p>Frank nodded.</p>

<p>"To a swell as great as himself. To Lady Lenore Beauchamp."</p>

<p>The smile died away from Stella's lips, and her face paled.</p>

<p>It was false and ridiculous, but the mere rumor struck her,
not with a dagger's but a pin's point.</p>

<p>"Is he?" she said, feeling deceitful and guilty, and she walked
on in silence to the river's bank, while Frank ran on telling all
he knew of Lord Leycester's swelldom. According to Frank
he was a very great swell indeed, a sort of prince amongst men,
and as Stella listened her heart went out to the boy in gratitude.</p>

<p>And she was to marry this great man!</p>

<p>They reached the river's bank, and Lord Leycester, who had
been watching them, put down his rod and came across.</p>

<p>Stella held out her hand, her face crimson with a warm blush,
her eyes downcast.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Stel&mdash;Miss Etheridge?" he said, pressing
her hand; then he glanced at Frank.</p>

<p>"This is my cousin, Frank," said Stella. "Frank Etheridge."</p>

<p>Frank, with his blue eyes wide open with awe, looked up at
the handsome face of the "awful swell," and bowed respectfully;
but Lord Leycester held out his hand, and smiled at him&mdash;the
rare sweet smile.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Mr. Etheridge?" he said, warmly, and at
the greeting the boy's heart leaped up and his face flushed. "I
am very glad to meet you," went on Leycester, in his frank way&mdash;just
the way to enslave a boy&mdash;"very glad, indeed, for I was
feeling bored to death with rod and line. Are you fond of fishing?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Will you come for a row? Do you think you can persuade
your cousin to accompany us?"</p>

<p>Frank looked up eagerly at Stella, who stood, her beautiful
face downcast and grave, but for the little tremulous smile of
happiness which shone in the dark eyes and played about the
lips.</p>

<p>"Do, Stella!" he said, "do let us go!"</p>

<p>Stella looked up with a smile, and Lord Leycester helped her
into the boat.</p>

<p>"You can row?" he said to Frank.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Frank, eagerly, "I can row."</p>

<p>"You shall pull behind me, then," said Leycester.</p>

<p>They took up sculls, and Lord Leycester, as he leaned forward
for the stroke, spoke in a low tone:</p>

<p>"My darling! Have you wondered where I have been?"</p>

<p>Stella glanced at Frank, pulling away manfully.</p>

<p>"He cannot hear," whispered Leycester; "the noise of the
sculls prevents him. Are you angry with me for being away?"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"You haven't missed me?"</p>

<p>"I have missed you!" she said, sharply.</p>

<p>His heart leaped at the plain, frank avowal.</p>

<p>"I have been to London," he said. "There has been some
trouble about some foolish, tiresome horses; I was obliged to go.
Stella, every hour seemed an age to me! I dared not write; I
could not send a message. Stella, I want to speak to you very
particularly. Will he be offended if I get rid of him. He seems
a nice boy!"</p>

<p>"Frank is the dearest boy in the world," she said, eagerly.</p>

<p>Leycester nodded.</p>

<p>"I did not know Mr. Etheridge had a son&mdash;it is his son?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said; "neither did I know it; but he is the dearest
boy."</p>

<p>Leycester looked round.</p>

<p>"Frank," he said&mdash;"you don't mind my calling you Frank?"</p>

<p>Frank colored.</p>

<p>"It is very friendly of your lordship."</p>

<p>Leycester smiled.</p>

<p>"I shall think you are offended if you address me in that
way," he said. "My name is Leycester. If you call me 'my
lord,' I shall have to call you 'sir.' I can't help being a lord, you
know. It's my misfortune, not my fault."</p>

<p>Frank laughed.</p>

<p>"I wish it was my misfortune, or my fault," he said.</p>

<p>Leycester smiled.</p>

<p>"There is a jack just opposite where I was fishing; I saw him
half an hour ago. Would you like to try for him?"</p>

<p>Frank put the sculls up at once.</p>

<p>"All right," said Leycester, and he pulled for the shore.</p>

<p>"You'll find my rod quite ready. You'll stay here Stel&mdash;Miss
Etheridge. We'll pull about gently till Frank has caught his
fish."</p>

<p>Frank sprang to land and ran to the spot where Leycester had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
left his rod, and Leycester sculled up stream again for a few
strokes, then he put the sculls down and leant forward, and
seized Stella's hand.</p>

<p>"He will see you," said Stella, blushing.</p>

<p>"No, he will not," he retorted, and he bent until his lips touched
her hand. "Stella, I want to speak to you very seriously.
You must promise you will not be angry with me."</p>

<p>Stella looked at him with a smile.</p>

<p>"Is it so serious," she said, in that low, murmuring voice
which a woman uses when she speaks to the man she loves.</p>

<p>"Very," he said, gravely, but with the bold, defiant look in
his eyes which presaged some bold, defiant deed. "Stella, I want
you to marry me."</p>

<p>Stella started, and her hand closed spasmodically on his.</p>

<p>"I want you to marry me soon," he went on&mdash;"at once."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no!" she said, in a whisper, and her hand trembled
in his.</p>

<p>Marry him at once! The thought was so full of immensity
that it overwhelmed her.</p>

<p>"But it must be 'Yes! yes! yes!'" he said. "My darling, I
find that I cannot live without you. I cannot! I cannot! You
will take pity on me!"</p>

<p>Take pity on him&mdash;the great Lord Leycester; the most popular
man in London; the heir to Wyndward; the hero of whom
Frank had been speaking so enthusiastically; while she was but
Stella Etheridge, the painter's penniless niece.</p>

<p>"What am I to say? what can I say?" she said, in a low voice,
her eyes downcast, her heart beating fast.</p>

<p>"I will tell you," he said. "You must say 'Yes,' my darling,
to all I ask you."</p>

<p>There was a moment's pause, in which she felt that indeed she
must say 'Yes' to anything he asked her.</p>

<p>"Listen, darling," he went on, caressing her hand, his eyes
fixed on her face wistfully. "I have been thinking of this love
of ours, thinking of it night and day, and I feel that you and I
can do no good by waiting. You are happy&mdash;yes, because you
are a woman; but I am not happy, because, perhaps, that I am
a man. I shall not be happy until we are one&mdash;until you are my
very own. Stella, we must be married at once."</p>

<p>"Not at once," she pleaded.</p>

<p>"At once," he said; and there was a strange, eager, impatient
light in his eyes. "Stella, I can speak to you as I can speak to
no one else&mdash;you and I are one in thought&mdash;you are my other
self. My darling, I would go through fire to save you a moment's
pain, not only pain, but uneasiness and annoyance."</p>

<p>Her fingers closed on his hand, and her eyes, raised to his face
for a moment, plainly said, "I believe it;" but her lips said
nothing.</p>

<p>"Stella, there would be pain and annoyance to you, if&mdash;if we
were to make known our love. It is a foolish, stupid, idiotic
world; but as the world is, we must accept it&mdash;we cannot alter
it. If we were to declare our love, all sorts of people would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
arrayed against us. Do you think your uncle would consent to
it?"</p>

<p>Stella thought a moment.</p>

<p>"I know what you mean," she said, in a low voice. "No,
uncle would not consent. But it is not that only. Lady Wyndward&mdash;the
earl&mdash;no one of your people would consent."</p>

<p>His lips curled.</p>

<p>"About their consent I care little," he said, in the quiet, defiant
manner peculiar to him. "But I do care for your happiness
and peace of mind, and I fear they might make you
unhappy and&mdash;uncomfortable. So, Stella, I think you and I had
better walk to church one fine morning, and say 'nothing to
nobody.'"</p>

<p>Stella started.</p>

<p>"Secretly, do you mean? Oh, Leycester!"</p>

<p>"My darling! Is it not best? Then when it is all over, and
you are my very own, nobody will say anything, because it will
be no good to say anything! Stella, it must be so! If we waited
until we got everybody's consent, we might wait until we
were as old as Methuselah!"</p>

<p>"But uncle!" murmured Stella. "He has been so good to
me."</p>

<p>"And I will be good to you!" he murmured, with such sweet
significance that the beautiful face crimsoned. "He only wants
to see you happy, and I will make you happy, my darling&mdash;my
own!"</p>

<p>As he spoke he took her hand, and held it to his lips as if he
never meant to part with it, and Stella could not find a word to
say. If she had found a word it would have been 'Yes.'</p>

<p>He was silent a moment&mdash;thinking. Then he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Stella, you think I have some plan ready, but I have not. I
would not even think of a plan till I got your consent. Now I
have got your consent&mdash;I have, haven't I?"</p>

<p>Stella was silent, but her hand closed over his.</p>

<p>"I will think. I will make a plan. We shall want some one
to help us."</p>

<p>He thought a moment, then he looked up with a smile.</p>

<p>"I know! It shall be&mdash;Frank!"</p>

<p>"Frank!" exclaimed Stella.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes, I like him. I like him because he likes you. Stella,
that boy adores you."</p>

<p>Stella smiled.</p>

<p>"He is a dear good boy."</p>

<p>"He shall help us. He shall be our Mercury, and carry messages.
Do you know, Stella, that you and I have never written
to each other since we have been engaged? When I was in
London, I longed for some memento of you, some written line,
something you had touched. You will write now, darling,
and Frank shall act as messenger. I will think it all out, and
send you word, if I do not see you. Frank and I must be good
friends. It is quite true that the boy adores you. I can see it in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
his eyes. That is no wonder&mdash;anybody, everybody who knows
you must adore you, my darling."</p>

<p>Something has been said of the infinite charm possessed by
Leycester, a charm quite irresistible when he chose to exert it.
This morning he exerted it to the utmost extent. Stella felt in
dreamland and under a spell. If he had asked her to go to land
and marry him there and then&mdash;if he had asked her to follow him
to the ends of the world, she would have felt bound to so follow
him. She forgot time and place and everything as she listened
to him, for a time at least, but as the boat drifted down to the
spot where they had left Frank, she remembered the boy, and
looked up with a start.</p>

<p>"Frank is not there," she said. "Where has he gone?"</p>

<p>Leycester looked up smiling.</p>

<p>"You are a sister to him!" he said. "He must have wandered
down the bank. He is all right."</p>

<p>Then he looked down the river, and a sudden light came into
his eyes.</p>

<p>"The foolish boy," he said. "He has gone on to the weir."</p>

<p>"The weir!" exclaimed Stella.</p>

<p>"Don't be frightened," he said. "He is all right. He is standing
on the wooden stage over the weir."</p>

<p>Stella looked round.</p>

<p>"He will fall!" she said. "Isn't it very dangerous?"</p>

<p>It did look dangerous. Frank had climbed on to the weir bars
and was standing over a narrow beam, his legs apart, his eyes
fixed on the big float which danced in the foaming water.</p>

<p>"He is all right," said Leycester. "I'll tell him to come off.
Don't be alarmed, my darling. You have gone quite pale!"</p>

<p>"Call to him to come off at once," said Stella.</p>

<p>Leycester rowed to land, and they both walked to the weir, a
few paces only.</p>

<p>"Better come off there, Frank," called out Leycester.</p>

<p>Frank looked round.</p>

<p>"I've just had a touch," he said. "There is a tremendous
jack there, or perhaps it's a trout; he'll come again directly."</p>

<p>"Come off," said Leycester. "You are frightening Stella&mdash;your
cousin."</p>

<p>"All right," said Frank, but at the moment the fish, jack or
trout, seized the bait, and with an exultant cry, Frank jerked
his rod.</p>

<p>"I've got him!" he shouted. "It's a monster! Have you got
a net Lord&mdash;I mean Leycester?"</p>

<p>"No, bother the net and the fish too," said Leycester. "Leave
the fish and come off; your cousin is alarmed."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well," said Frank, and he jerked the rod to get clear
of the fish, and at the same moment turned warily toward the
shore.</p>

<p>But the fish&mdash;jack or trout&mdash;had got a firm hold, and was not
disposed to go, and making a turn to the open river, put a strain
on the rod which Frank had not expected.</p>

<p>It was a question whether he should drop the rod or cling on.</p>

<p>He decided on the latter, and the next moment he missed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
footing and fell into the foaming water. Stella did not utter a
cry&mdash;it was not her way of expressing her emotion&mdash;but she
grasped Leycester's arm.</p>

<p>"All right, my darling," he murmured; "it is all right," and
as he spoke, he put her hand from his arm gently and tenderly.</p>

<p>The next moment he had torn off his coat, and springing on
the weir stood for just a second to calculate the distance, and
dived off.</p>

<p>Stella, even then, did not shriek, but she sank speechless on
the bank, and with clasped hands and agonized terror, watched
the struggle.</p>

<p>Lord Leycester rose to the surface almost instantly. He was
a skilled diver and a powerful swimmer, and he had not lost his
presence of mind for a moment.</p>

<p>It was a terrible place to jump from&mdash;a still more terrible
place from which to rescue a drowning person; but Lord Leycester
had done the thing before, and he was not afraid.</p>

<p>He saw the boy's golden head come up a few yards beyond
where he, Lord Leycester, rose, and he struck out for it. A few
stokes, and he reached and grasped him.</p>

<p>"Don't cling to me, my boy" he gasped.</p>

<p>"No fear, Lord Leycester!" gasped Frank, in return.</p>

<p>Then Lord Leycester seized him by the hair, and striking out
for the shore, fought hard.</p>

<p>It was a hard fight. The recoil of the stream, as it fell from
the weir, was tremendous; it was like forcing one's way through
liquid iron. But Lord Leycester did force his way, and still
clinging to the boy's hair, dragged him ashore.</p>

<p>Dripping wet, they stood and looked at each other. Then
Lord Leycester laughed; but Frank, the boy, did not.</p>

<p>"Lord Leycester," he said, speaking pantingly, "you have
saved my life."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" said Leycester, shaking himself; "I have had a
pleasant bath, that's all!"</p>

<p>"You have saved my life," said Frank, solemnly. "I should
never have been able to force my way through that current
alone. I know what a weir stream is."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said Leycester, again. Then he turned to where
Stella stood, white and trembling. "Don't be frightened, Stella;
don't be frightened, darling!"</p>

<p>The word was said before he could recall it, and he glanced at
Frank.</p>

<p>Frank nodded.</p>

<p>"I know," he said with a smile. "I knew it half an hour ago;
since you first spoke to her."</p>

<p>"Frank!" murmured Stella.</p>

<p>"I knew he loved you," said Frank, calmly. "He could not
help it; how could anybody help it who knew you?"</p>

<p>Leycester laid his hand on the boy's arm.</p>

<p>"You must go home at once," he said, gently.</p>

<p>"You have saved my life," said Frank again. "Lord Leycester,
I shall never forget it. Perhaps some day I shall be able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
repay you. It seems unlikely; but remember the story of the
lion and the mouse."</p>

<p>"Never mind the lion and the mouse," said Leycester, smiling,
as he wrung the Thames water from his clothes. "You must
get home at once."</p>

<p>"But I do remember the lion and the mouse," said Frank, his
teeth chattering. "You have saved my life."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Stella stood wordless and motionless, her eyes
wandering from her lover to Frank.</p>

<p>Wordless, because she could find no words to express her admiration
for her lover's heroism.</p>

<p>At last she spoke.</p>

<p>"Oh, Leycester!" she said, and that was all.</p>

<p>Leycester took her in his arms and kissed her.</p>

<p>"Frank," he said, "you must keep our secret."</p>

<p>"I would lay down my life for either of you," said the boy,
looking up at him.</p>

<p>They went down to the boat in silence, and Leycester rowed
them across in silence; then, as they landed, Frank spoke again,
and there was a strange light in his eyes.</p>

<p>"I know," he said. "I know your secret. I would lay down
my life for you!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Stella</span> hurried Frank across the meadows, a rather difficult
task, as he would insist upon talking, his teeth chattering, and
his clothes dripping.</p>

<p>"What a splendid fellow, Stella! What a happy girl you
ought to be&mdash;you are!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I am," assented Stella, with a little smile; "but do
you make haste, Frank! Can't you run any faster? I'll race
you to the lane!"</p>

<p>"No, you won't," he retorted cheerfully. "You run like a
greyhound at the best of times, and now I seem to have got
a couple of tons clinging to me, you'd beat me hollow. But,
Stella! think of him plunging off the beam! Many a man
would have been satisfied to jump off the bank; if he had, he
wouldn't have saved me! He knew that; and he made nothing
of it, nothing! And that is the man they call a dandy and a
fop!"</p>

<p>"Never mind what they call him, but run!" implored Stella.</p>

<p>"I don't know any other man who could have done it," he
went on, his teeth chattering; "and how friendly and jolly he
was, calling me Frank and telling me to call him Leycester!
Stella, what a lucky girl you are; but he is not a bit too good
for you after all! No one is too good for you! And he does
love you, Stella; I could see it by the way he looked at you, and
you thought to hide it, and that I shouldn't see it. Did you
think I was a muff?"</p>

<p>"I think you will be laid up with a bad cold, sir, if you don't
run!" said Stella. "What will uncle say?"</p>

<p>Frank stopped short and his face paled; he seemed to shrink.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>"My father must know nothing about it," he said. "Don't
tell him, Stella; I will get in the back way and change. Don't
tell him!"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;&mdash;" said Stella.</p>

<p>"No, no," he reiterated; "I don't want him to know. It will
only trouble him, and"&mdash;his voice faltered&mdash;"I have given him
so much trouble."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Stella. "But come along or you will be ill,
and then he must know."</p>

<p>This appeared to have the desired effect, and he took her hand
and set off at a run. They reached the lane, and were just turning
into it, when the tall, thin figure of Jasper emerged.</p>

<p>Both Stella and Frank stopped, and she felt his hand close
in hers tightly.</p>

<p>"Stella, here's that man Adelstone," he said, in a whisper of
aversion. "Must we stop?"</p>

<p>Jasper settled that question by raising his hat, and coming
forward with outstretched hand.</p>

<p>"Good-evening!" he said, his small, keen eyes glancing from
Stella to the boy, and taking in the fact of the wet clothes in a
moment.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?"</p>

<p>"Nothing much," said Stella with a smile, and hurriedly.
"My cousin has fallen into the water. We are hurrying
home."</p>

<p>"Fallen in the water!" said Jasper, turning and walking beside
them. "How did he manage that?"</p>

<p>Frank was silent, and Stella, with a little flush, said, gravely:</p>

<p>"We were on the water&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I was fishing from the weir," broke in Frank, pressing her
hand, warningly, "and I fell in; that is all."</p>

<p>There was something almost like defiance in the tone and the
glance he gave at the sinister face.</p>

<p>"Into the weir stream!" exclaimed Jasper, "and you got
ashore! You must be a good swimmer, my dear Frank!"</p>

<p>"I am&mdash;pretty well," said Frank, almost sullenly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you had the waterman to help you," said Jasper,
looking from one to the other.</p>

<p>Then Stella, who felt that it would be better to speak out,
said, gravely:</p>

<p>"Lord Leycester was near, and leapt in and saved him."</p>

<p>Jasper's face paled, and an angry light shot from his eyes.</p>

<p>"How fortunate that he should happen to be near!" he said.
"It was brave of him!"</p>

<p>There was a suspicion of a sneer in the thin voice that roused
the spirit of the boy.</p>

<p>"It was brave," he said. "Perhaps you don't know what it
is to swim through a weir current, Mr. Adelstone?"</p>

<p>Jasper smiled down at the flushed, upturned face.</p>

<p>"No, but I think I should have tried if I had been lucky
enough to be in Lord Leycester's place."</p>

<p>"I'm very glad you weren't," said Frank, in a low voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am sure you would," said Stella, quickly. "Anyone
would. Come, Frank. Good-evening, Mr. Adelstone."</p>

<p>Jasper paused and looked at her. She looked very beautiful
with her flushed face and eager eyes, and his heart was beating
rapidly.</p>

<p>"I came out hoping to see you, Miss Etheridge," he said.
"May I come in?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course; uncle will be very pleased," she said. "But
go in the front way, please; we are going in at the back, because
we don't wish uncle to know. It would only upset him.
You will not tell him, please?"</p>

<p>"You may always rely on my discretion," said Jasper.</p>

<p>Stella, still holding Frank's hand, dragged him into the kitchen,
and stopped Mrs. Penfold's exclamation of dismay.</p>

<p>"Frank has had an accident, Mrs. Penfold. Yes, he fell in
the river. I'll tell you all about it afterward; but he must
change his things at once&mdash;at once. Run up, Frank, and get
into the blanket&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All right," he said; then, as he went out of the room, he took
her by the arm.</p>

<p>"Don't let that man stay, Stella. I&mdash;hate him."</p>

<p>"My dear Frank!"</p>

<p>"I hate him! What did he mean by sneering at Lord Leycester?"</p>

<p>"He doesn't like Lord Leycester," said Stella.</p>

<p>"Who cares?" exclaimed Frank, indignantly. "Curs are not
particularly fond of lions, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Stella would hear no more, but pushed him up the stairs with
anxious impatience; then she went into the studio. As she neared
the door she could hear Jasper Adelstone's voice. He was
talking to her uncle, and something in the tone struck her as
peculiar, and struck her unpleasantly.</p>

<p>There was a tone of familiarity, almost of covert power in it
that annoyed her.</p>

<p>With her hand on the door she paused, and it seemed to her
as if she heard him speak her name; she was not sure, and she
would not wait, but with a little heightened color she opened
the door and entered.</p>

<p>As she did so Jasper laid his hand upon the old man's arm as
if to call his attention to her entrance, and the painter turned
round with a start, and looking at her intently, said, with evident
perplexity:</p>

<p>"A mere girl&mdash;a mere girl, Jasper!" and shaking his head, resumed
his work.</p>

<p>Jasper stood a moment, a smile on his face, watching Stella
from the corner of his eyes; then he said, suddenly:</p>

<p>"I have been admiring your roses, Miss Stella, and breaking
the last commandment. I have been coveting them."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Stella. "Pray take any you like, there are such
numbers of them that we can spare them; can we not, uncle?"</p>

<p>As usual, the painter took no notice, and Jasper, in a matter-of-fact
voice, said:</p>

<p>"Do you mind coming out and telling me which I may cut?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
I only want one or two to take to London with me, to brighten
my dull rooms."</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Stella, moving toward the window. "Are
you going to London?"</p>

<p>He muttered something and followed her out, his eyes taking
in the lithe grace of her figure with a hungry wistfulness.</p>

<p>"Now then," said Stella, standing in the middle of the path
and waving her hand:</p>

<p>"Which shall it be, white rose or red?" and she smiled up at
him.</p>

<p>He looked at her for a moment in silence. She had never appeared
to him more beautiful than this morning; there was a
subtle light of hidden joy shining in her eyes, a glow of youthful
hope about her face that set his heart beating with mingled
pleasure and pain&mdash;delight in the beauty which he had sworn
should be his, pain and torture in the thought that another&mdash;the
hated Lord Leycester&mdash;had already looked upon it that morning.</p>

<p>Even as he stood silently regarding her, a bitter suspicion
smote through his heart that the joyousness which shone from
the dark eyes had been set there by Lord Leycester. He bit
his lip and his face went pale, then with a start he came close to
her.</p>

<p>"Give me which you please," he said. "Here is a knife."</p>

<p>Stella took the knife heedlessly and carelessly. There was no
significance in the deed; she did not know that he would attach
any importance to the fact that she should cut the rose and give
it to him with her own hand; if she had so understood it she
would have dropped the knife as if it had been an adder.</p>

<p>In simple truth she was not thinking of him&mdash;scarcely saw him;
she was thinking of that lover, the god of her heart, and seeing
him as he swam through the river foam. For she was scarcely
conscious of Jasper Adelstone's presence, and in the acuteness
of his passion he almost suspected it.</p>

<p>"White or red?" she said, knife in hand.</p>

<p>He glanced at her.</p>

<p>"Red," he said, and his lips felt hot and dry.</p>

<p>Stella cut a red rose&mdash;a dark red rose, and with a little
womanly gesture put it to her face; it was a little girlish trick,
all unthinking, unconsciously done, but it sent the blood to the
heart of the man watching her in a sudden, passionate rush.</p>

<p>"There," she said; "it is a beauty. They speak of the roses
of Florence, but give me an English rose, Florentine roses are
fuller than these, but not so beautiful&mdash;oh, not so beautiful!
There," and she held it out to him, without looking at him. If
she had done so, she would have surely read something in the
white constrained face, and small, glittering eyes that would have
warned her.</p>

<p>He took it without a word. In simple truth he was trying to
restrain himself. He felt that the time was not ripe for action&mdash;that
a word of the devouring passion which consumed him
would be dangerous, and he whispered to himself, "Not yet!
not yet!" But her loveliness, that touch of the rose to his face,
overmastered his cool, calculating spirit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you," he said at last; "thank you very much. I
shall value it dearly. I shall put it on my desk in my dark,
grim room, and think of you."</p>

<p>Then Stella looked up and started slightly.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she said, hurriedly. "You would like some more perhaps?
Pray take what you would like," and she held out the
knife, and looked upon him with a sudden coldness in the eyes
that should have warned him.</p>

<p>"No, I want no more," he said. "All the roses that ever
bloomed would not add to my pleasure. It is this rose from
your hand that I value."</p>

<p>Stella made a slight movement toward the window, but he
put out his hand.</p>

<p>"Stay one moment&mdash;only a moment," he said, and in his
eagerness he put out his hand and touched her arm, the arm
sacred to Leycester.</p>

<p>Stella shrank back, and a little shudder swept through her.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what is it!" she asked, in a low voice that she tried to
make calm and cold and repressive.</p>

<p>He stood, shutting and opening the knife with a nervous restlessness,
as unlike his calm impassability as the streaming torrent
that forces its way through the mountain gorge is like the
lake at their feet; his eyes fixed on her face with anxious eagerness.</p>

<p>"I want to speak to you," he said. "Only a few words&mdash;a
very few words. Will you listen to me? I hope you will listen
to me."</p>

<p>Stella stood, her face turned away from him, her heart beating,
but coldly and with fear and repugnance, not as it had beat
when Leycester's low tones first fell upon her ear.</p>

<p>He moistened his lips again, and his hand closed over the shut
knife with a tight clasp, as if he were striving to regain self-command.</p>

<p>"I know it is unwise. I feel that&mdash;that you would rather not
listen to me, and that I shall do very little good by speaking, but
I cannot. There are times, Stella&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Stella moved slightly at the familiar name.</p>

<p>"There are times when a man loses self-control, when he
flings prudence to the winds, or rather, lets it slip from him.
This is one of those moments, Stella&mdash;Miss Etheridge; I feel that
I must speak, let it cost me what it may."</p>

<p>Still silent, she stood as if turned to stone. He put his hand
to his brow&mdash;his white, thin hand, with its carefully trimmed
nails&mdash;and wiped away the perspiration that stood in big beads.</p>

<p>"Miss Etheridge, I think you can guess what it is I want to
say, and I hope that you will not think any the less of me because
of my inability to say it as it should be said, as I would
have it said. Stella, if you look back, if you will recall the times
since first we met, you cannot fail to know my meaning."</p>

<p>She turned her face toward him for a moment, and shook her
head.</p>

<p>"You mean that I have no right to think so. Do you think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
that you, a woman, have not seen what every woman sees so
quickly when it is the case&mdash;that I have learned to love you!"</p>

<p>The word was out at last, and as it left him he trembled.</p>

<p>Stella did not start, but her face went paler than before, and
she shrank slightly.</p>

<p>"Yes," he went on, "I have learned to love you. I think I
loved you the first evening we met; I was not sure then, and&mdash;I
will tell you the whole truth, I have sworn to myself that I
would do it&mdash;I tried to fight against it. I am not a man easily
given to love; no, I am a man of the world&mdash;one who has to
make his way in the world, one who has an ambition; and I tried
to put you from my thoughts&mdash;I tried hard, but I failed."</p>

<p>He paused, and eyed her watchfully. Her face was like a
mask of stone.</p>

<p>"I grew to love you more day by day&mdash;I was not happy away
from you. I carried your image up with me to London&mdash;it came
between me and my work; but I was patient&mdash;I told myself that
I should gain nothing by being too rash&mdash;that I must give you
time to know me, and to&mdash;to love me."</p>

<p>He paused and moistened his lips, and looked at her. Why
did she not speak&mdash;of what was she thinking?</p>

<p>At that moment, if he could but have known it, she was
thinking of her true lover&mdash;of the young lord who had not
waited and calculated, but who had poured the torrent of his
passionate love at her feet&mdash;had taken her in his arms and made
her love him. And as she thought, how small, how mean this
other man seemed to her!</p>

<p>"I gave you mine&mdash;I meant to give you more," he continued;
"I want to do something worthy of your love. I am&mdash;I am not
a rich man, Stella&mdash;I have no title&mdash;as yet&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Stella's eyes flashed for a moment, and her lips closed. It was
an unlucky speech for him.</p>

<p>"No, not yet; but I shall have riches and title&mdash;I have set my
mind on them, and there is nothing that I have set my mind
on that I have not got, or will not get&mdash;nothing!" he repeated,
with almost fierce intensity.</p>

<p>Still she did not speak. Like a bird charmed, fascinated by a
snake, she stood, listening though every word was torture to her.</p>

<p>"I have set my mind on winning your love, Stella. I love
you as few men love, with all my heart and soul. There is
nothing I would not do to win you, there is nothing I would&mdash;pause
at."</p>

<p>A faint shudder stole through her; and he saw it, and added,
quickly:</p>

<p>"I would do anything to make you happy&mdash;move heaven and
earth to see you always smiling as you smiled this morning.
Stella, I love you! What have you to say to me?"</p>

<p>He stopped, white and seemingly exhausted, his thin lips
tightly compressed, his whole frame quivering.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Stella</span>, turned her eyes upon him, and something like pity
took possession of her for a moment. It was a womanly feeling,
and it softened her reply.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;am very sorry," she said, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Sorry!" he repeated, hoarsely, quickly. "Do not say that!"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I am very sorry," she repeated. "I&mdash;I&mdash;did not
know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did not know that I loved you!" he retorted, almost sharply.
"Were you blind? Every word, every look of mine would have
told you, if you had cared to know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her face flushed, and she raised her eyes to his with a flash of
indignation.</p>

<p>"I did not know!" she breathed.</p>

<p>"Forgive me!" he pleaded hoarsely. "I&mdash;I am very unfortunate.
I offend and anger you! I told you that I should not
be able to say what I had to say with credit to myself. Pray
forgive me. I meant that though I tried to hide my love, it
must have betrayed itself. How could it be otherwise? Stella,
have you no other word for me?"</p>

<p>"None," she said, looking away. "I am very sorry. I did
not know. But it could not have been. Never."</p>

<p>He stood regarding her, his breath coming in long gasps.</p>

<p>"You mean you never can love me?" he asked.</p>

<p>Stella raised her eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said.</p>

<p>His hand closed over the knife until the back of the blade
pressed deeply into the quivering palm.</p>

<p>"Never is&mdash;is a long day," he said, hoarsely. "Do not say
'never.' I will be patient; see, I am patient, I am calm now,
and will not offend you again! I will be patient and wait; I will
wait for years, if you will but give me hope&mdash;if you will but try
to love me a little!"</p>

<p>Stella's face paled, and her lips quivered.</p>

<p>"I cannot," she said, in a low voice. "You&mdash;you do not
understand. One cannot teach oneself to love&mdash;cannot <i>try</i>. It
is impossible. Besides&mdash;you do not know what you ask. You
do not understand!"</p>

<p>"Do I not?" he said, and a bitter sneer curled the thin lips.
"I do understand. I know&mdash;I have a suspicion of the reason
why you answer me like this."</p>

<p>Stella's face burnt for a moment, then went pale, but her eyes
met his steadily.</p>

<p>"There is something behind your refusal; no girl would speak
as you do unless there was something behind. There is someone
else. Am I not right?"</p>

<p>"You have no right to ask me!" said Stella, firmly.</p>

<p>"My love gives me the right to ask. But I need not put the
question, and there is no necessity for you to answer. If you
have been blind, I have not. I have seen and noted, and I tell
you, I tell you plainly, that what you hope for cannot be. I say
cannot&mdash;shall not be!" he added, between his closed teeth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>Stella's eyes flashed as she stood before him glorious in her
loveliness.</p>

<p>"Have you finished?" she asked.</p>

<p>He was silent, regarding her watchfully.</p>

<p>"If you have finished, Mr. Adelstone, I will leave you."</p>

<p>"Stay," he said, and he stood in the path so that she could not
pass him, "Stay one moment. I will not ask you to reconsider
your reply. I will only ask you to forgive me." His voice
grew hoarse, and his eyes drooped. "Yes, I will beg you to forgive
me. Think of what I am suffering, and you will not refuse
me that. Forgive me, Stella&mdash;Miss Etheridge! I have been
wrong, mad, and brutal; but it has sprung from the depth of
my love; I am not altogether to blame. Will you say that you
will forgive me, and that&mdash;that we remain friends?"</p>

<p>Stella paused.</p>

<p>He watched her eagerly.</p>

<p>"If&mdash;if," he said quickly, before she could speak&mdash;"if you
will let this pass as if it had not been&mdash;if you will forget all I
have said&mdash;I will promise not to offend again. Do not let us
part&mdash;do not send me away never to see you again. I am an old
friend of your uncle's; I should not like to lose his friendship; I
think I may say that he would miss mine. Let us be friends, Miss
Etheridge."</p>

<p>Stella inclined her head.</p>

<p>"Thank you, thank you," he said, meekly, tremulously; "I
shall be very grateful for your friendship, Miss Stella. I will
keep the rose to remind me of your forbearance," and he was
patting the rose in his coat, when Stella with a start stretched
out her hand.</p>

<p>"No! give it me back, please," she said.</p>

<p>He stood eying her.</p>

<p>"Let me keep it," he said; "it is a little thing."</p>

<p>"No!" she said, firmly, and her face burnt. "You must not
keep it. I&mdash;I did not think when I gave it to you! Give it me
back, please," and she held out her hand.</p>

<p>He still hesitated, and Stella, overstrained, made a step toward
him.</p>

<p>"Give it me," she said. "I must&mdash;I will have it!"</p>

<p>An angry flush came on his face, and he held the rose from
her.</p>

<p>"It is mine," he said. "You gave it to me; I cannot give it
back."</p>

<p>The words had scarcely left his lips, when the rose was dashed
from his hand, and Frank stood white and panting between
them.</p>

<p>"How dare you!" he gasped, passionately, his hands clinched,
his eyes gleaming fiercely upon the white face. "How dare
you!" and with a savage exclamation the boy dashed his foot
on the flower, and ground it under his heel.</p>

<p>The action, so full of scornful defiance, spurred Jasper back
to consciousness. With a smothered oath he grasped the boy's
shoulders.</p>

<p>Frank turned upon him with the savage ferocity of a wild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
animal, with upraised arm. Then, suddenly, like a lightning
flash, Jasper's face changed and a convulsive smile forced itself
upon his lips.</p>

<p>He caught the arm and held it, and smiled down at him.</p>

<p>"My dear Frank," he murmured. "What is the matter?"</p>

<p>So sudden was the change, so unexpected, that Stella, who
had caught the boy's other arm, stood transfixed.</p>

<p>Frank gasped.</p>

<p>"What did you mean by keeping the rose?" he burst out.</p>

<p>Jasper laughed softly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I see!" he said, nodding with amused playfulness. "I
see. You were watching&mdash;from the window, perhaps, eh?" and
he shook his arm playfully. "And like a great many other
spectators, took jest for earnest! Impetuous boy!"</p>

<p>Frank looked at the pale, smiling face, and at Stella's downcast
one.</p>

<p>"Is it true?" he asked Stella, bluntly.</p>

<p>"Oh, come!" said Jasper, reproachfully. "Isn't that rather
rude? But I must forgive you, and I do it easily, my dear
Frank, when I remember that your sudden onslaught was
prompted by a desire to champion Miss Stella! Now come, you
owe me a rose, go and cut me one, and we will be friends&mdash;great
friends, will we not?"</p>

<p>Frank slid from his grasp, but stood eying him suspiciously.</p>

<p>"You will not?" said Jasper. "Still uncertain lest it should
have been sober earnest? Then I will cut one for myself. May
I?" and he smiled at Stella.</p>

<p>Stella did not speak, but she inclined her head.</p>

<p>Jasper went to one of the standards and cut a red rose deliberately
and carefully, and placed it in his coat, then he cut another,
and with a smile held it to Stella.</p>

<p>"Will that do instead of the one the stupid boy has spoiled?"
he said, laughing.</p>

<p>Stella would have liked to refuse it, but Frank's eyes were
upon her.</p>

<p>Slowly she held out her hand and took the rose.</p>

<p>A smile of triumph glittered for a moment in Jasper's eyes,
then he put his hand on Frank's shoulder.</p>

<p>"My dear Frank," he said, in a soft voice, "you must be careful;
you must repress that impulsive temper of yours, must he
not?" and he turned to Stella and held out his hand. "Good-bye!
It is so dangerous, you know," he murmured, holding
Stella's hand, but keeping his smiling eyes fixed on the boy's
face. "Why, some of these days you will be doing someone an
injury and find yourself in prison, doing as they call it, six
months' hard labor, like a common thief&mdash;or forger!" and he
laughed, as if it were the best joke in the world.</p>

<p>Not so Frank. As the bantering words left the thin, smiling
lips, Frank recoiled suddenly, and his face went white.</p>

<p>Jasper looked at him.</p>

<p>"And now you are sorry?" he said. "Tell me it was only
your fun! Why, my dear boy, you wear your heart on your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
sleeve! Well, if you would really like to beg my pardon, you
may do it."</p>

<p>The boy turned his white face toward him.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;beg&mdash;your&mdash;pardon," he said, as if every word cost him
an agony, and then, with a sudden twitch of the face, he turned
and went slowly with bent head toward the house.</p>

<p>Jasper looked after him with a steely, cruel glitter in his eyes,
and he laughed softly.</p>

<p>"Dear boy!" he murmured; "I have taken so fond a liking
for him, and this only deepens it! He did it for your sake. You
did not think I meant to keep the rose! No; I should have given
it to you! But I may keep this! I will! to remind me of your
promise that we may still be friends!"</p>

<p>And he let her hand go, and walked away.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Lord Leycester</span> was on fire as he strode up the hill to the
Hall, and that notwithstanding he was wet to the skin. He was
on fire with love. He swore to himself, as he climbed up the
slope, that there was no one like his Stella, no one so beautiful,
so lovable and sweet as the dark-eyed girl who had stolen his
heart from him that moonlight night in the lane.</p>

<p>And he also vowed that he would wait no longer for the inestimable
treasure, the exquisite happiness that lay within his
grasp.</p>

<p>His great wealth, his time honored title seemed as nothing to
him compared with the thought of possessing the first real
love of his life.</p>

<p>He smiled rather seriously as he pictured his father's anger,
his mother's dismay and despair, and Lil's, dear Lilian's, grief;
but it was a smile, though a serious one.</p>

<p>"They will get over it when it has once been done. After all,
barring that she has no title and no money&mdash;neither of which are
wanted, by the way&mdash;she is as delightful a daughter-in-law as
any mother or father could wish for. Yes; I'll do it!"</p>

<p>But how? that was the question.</p>

<p>"There is no Gretna Green nowadays," he pondered, regretfully.
"I wish there were! A ride to the border, with my
darling by my side, nestling close to me all the way with mingled
love and alarm, would be worth taking. A man can't very well
put up the banns in any out-of-the-way place, because there are
few out-of-the-way places where they haven't heard of us Wyndwards.
By Jove!" he muttered, with a little start&mdash;"there is a
special license. I was almost forgetting that! That comes of
not being used to being married. A special license!" and pondering
deeply he reached the house.</p>

<p>The party at the hall was very small indeed now, but Lady
Lenore and Lord Charles still remained. Lenore had once or
twice declared that she must go, but Lady Wyndward had entreated
her to stay.</p>

<p>"Do not go, Lenore," she had said, with gentle significance.
"You know&mdash;you must know that we count upon you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>She did not say for what purpose she counted upon her, but
Lenore had understood, and had smiled with that faint, sweet
smile which constituted one of her charms.</p>

<p>Lord Charles stayed because Leycester was still there.</p>

<p>"Of course I ought to go, Lady Wyndward," he said; "you
must be heartily tired of me, but who is to play billiards with
Leycester if I go, or who is to keep him in order, don't you see?"
and so he had stayed, with one or two others who were only
too glad to remain at the Hall out of the London dust and
turmoil.</p>

<p>By all it was quite understood that Lord Leycester should be
considered as quite a free agent, free to come and go as he chose,
and never to be counted on; they were as surprised as they
were gratified if he joined them in a drive or a walk, and were
never astonished when he disappeared without furnishing any
clew to his intentions.</p>

<p>Lady Wyndward bore it all very patiently; she knew that
what Lady Longford had said was quite true, that it was useless
to attempt to drive him; but she did say a word to the old
countess.</p>

<p>"There is something amiss!" she said, with a sigh, and the
old countess had smiled and shown her teeth.</p>

<p>"Of course there is, my dear Ethel," she retorted; "there
always is where he is concerned. He is about some mischief, I
am as convinced as you are. But it does not matter, it will come
all right in time."</p>

<p>"But will it?" asked Lady Wyndward with a sigh.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so," said the old countess, "and Lenore agrees
with me, or she would not stay."</p>

<p>"It is very good of her to stay," said Lady Wyndward, with
a sigh.</p>

<p>"Very!" assented the old lady, with a smile. "It is encouraging.
I am sure she would not stay if she did not see excuse.
Yes, Ethel it will all come right; he will marry Lenore, or
rather, she will marry him, and they will settle down, and&mdash;I
don't know whether you have asked me to stand god-mother to
the first child."</p>

<p>Lady Wyndward tried to feel encouraged and confident,
but she felt uneasy. She was surprised that Lenore still remained.
She knew nothing of that meeting between the proud
beauty and Jasper Adelstone.</p>

<p>And Lenore! A great change had come over her. She herself
could scarcely understand it.</p>

<p>At night&mdash;as she sat before her glass while her maid brushed
out the long tresses that fell over the white shoulders like a
stream of liquid gold&mdash;she asked herself what it meant? Was
it really true that she was in love with Lord Leycester? She
had not been in love with him when she first came to the Hall&mdash;she
would have smiled away the suggestion if anyone had
made it; but now&mdash;how was it with her now? And as she
asked herself the question, a crimson flush would stain the
beautiful face, and the violet eyes would gleam with mingled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
shame and self-scorn, so that the maid would eye her wonderingly
under respectfully lowered lids.</p>

<p>Yes, she was forced to admit that she did love him&mdash;love him
with a passion which was a torture rather than a joy. She had
not known the full extent of that passion until the hour when
she had stood concealed between the trees at the river, and heard
Leycester's voice murmuring words of love to another.</p>

<p>And that other! An unknown, miserable, painter's niece!
Often, at night, when the great Hall was hushed and still, she
lay tossing to and fro with miserable longing and intolerable
shame, as she recalled that hour when she had been discovered
by Jasper Adelstone and forced to become his confederate.</p>

<p>She, the great beauty&mdash;before whom princes had bent in
homage&mdash;to be love-smitten by a man whose heart was given to
another&mdash;she to be the confederate and accomplice of a scheming,
under-bred lawyer.</p>

<p>It was intolerable, unbearable, but it was true&mdash;it was true;
and in the very keenest paroxysm of her shame she would
confess that she would do all that she had done, would conspire
with even a baser one than Jasper Adelstone to gain her
end.</p>

<p>"She!" she would murmur in the still watches of the night&mdash;"she
to marry the man to whom I have given my love! It is
impossible&mdash;it shall not be! Though I have to move heaven and
earth, it shall not be."</p>

<p>And then, after a sleepless night, she would come down to
breakfast&mdash;fair, and sweet, and smiling&mdash;a little pale, perhaps,
but looking all the lovelier for such paleness, without the shadow
of a care in the deep violet eyes.</p>

<p>Toward Leycester her bearing was simply perfection. She
did not wish to alarm him; she knew that a hint of what she
felt would put him on his guard, and she held herself in severe
restraint.</p>

<p>Her manner to him was simply what it was to anyone else&mdash;exquisitely
refined and charming. If anything, she adopted a
lighter tone, and sought to and succeeded in calling forth his
rare laughter.</p>

<p>She deceived him completely.</p>

<p>"Lenore in love with me!" he said to himself more than once;
"the idea is ridiculous! What could have made the mother
imagine such a thing?"</p>

<p>And so they met freely and frankly, and he talked and laughed
with her at his ease, little dreaming that she was watching
him as a cat watches a mouse, and that not a thing he said or
did escaped her.</p>

<p>She knew by instinct where he spent the times in which he was
missing from the Hall, and pictured to herself the meetings between
him and the girl who had robbed her of his love. And as
the jealousy increased, so did the love which created it. Day by
day she realized still more fully that he had won her heart&mdash;that
it was gone to him forever&mdash;that her whole future happiness
depended upon him.</p>

<p>The very tone of his voice, so deep and musical&mdash;his rare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
laugh&mdash;the smile that made his face so gay and bright&mdash;yes,
even the bursts of the passionate temper which lit up the dark
eyes with sudden fire, were precious to her.</p>

<p>"Yes, I love him," she murmured to herself&mdash;"it is all summed
up in that. I love him."</p>

<p>And Leycester, still smiling to himself over his mother's
"amusing mistake," was all unsuspecting. All his thoughts
were of Stella.</p>

<p>Now as he came toward the terrace, she stood with Lady
Longford and Lord Charles looking down at him.</p>

<p>She watched him, her cheek resting on her white hand, her
face hidden from the rest by the sunshade, whose lining of
hearty blue harmonized with the golden hair, and "her heart
hungered," as Victor Hugo says.</p>

<p>"Here's Leycester," said Lord Charles.</p>

<p>Lady Longford looked over the balustrade.</p>

<p>"What has he been doing? Rowing&mdash;fishing?"</p>

<p>"He went out with a fishing rod," said Lord Charles, with a
grin, "but the fish appear to have devoured it; at any rate
Leycester hasn't got it now. Hullo, old man, where have you
been? Come up here!"</p>

<p>Leycester sprang up the steps and stood beside Lenore. It
was the first time she had seen him that morning, and she inclined
her head and held out her hand with a smile.</p>

<p>He took her hand; it was warm and soft, his own was still
cold from his bath, and she opened her eyes widely.</p>

<p>"Your hand is quite cold," she said, then she touched his
sleeve, "and you are wet. Where have you been?"</p>

<p>Leycester laughed carelessly.</p>

<p>"I have met with a slight accident, and gained a pleasant
bath."</p>

<p>"An accident?" she repeated, not curiously, but with calm,
serene interest.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, shortly, "a young friend of mine fell into the
river, and I joined company, just for company's sake."</p>

<p>"I understand," she said with a smile, "you went in to save
him."</p>

<p>"Well, that's putting rather a fine point to it," he said, smilingly.</p>

<p>"But it's true. May one ask his name?"</p>

<p>Leycester flicked a piece of moss from the stone coping and
hesitated for a moment:</p>

<p>"His name is Frank," he said; "Frank Etheridge."</p>

<p>Lady Lenore nodded.</p>

<p>"A pretty name; I don't remember it. I hope he is grateful."</p>

<p>"I hope so," said Leycester. "I am sure he is more grateful
than the occasion merits."</p>

<p>The old countess looked round at him.</p>

<p>"What is it you say?" she said. "You have been in the river
after some boy, and you stand there lounging about in your wet
clothes? Well, the lad ought to be grateful, for though you
will not catch your death, you will in all probability catch a
chronic influenza cold, and that's worse than death; it's life with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
a pocket-handkerchief to your nose. Go and change your things
at once."</p>

<p>"I think I had better, after that fearful prognostication," said
Leycester, with a smile, and he sauntered off.</p>

<p>"Etheridge," said Lady Longford, "that is the name of that
pretty girl with the dark eyes who dined here the other night."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Lenore, indifferently, for the old countess looked
at her; she knew that the indifference was assumed.</p>

<p>"If Leycester doesn't take care, he will find himself in danger
with those dark eyes. Girls are apt to be grateful toward men
who rescue their cousins from a watery grave."</p>

<p>Lady Lenore shifted her sunshade and smiled serenely.</p>

<p>"No doubt she is very grateful. Why should she not be? Do
you think Lord Leycester is in danger? I do not." And she
strolled away.</p>

<p>The old lady glanced at Lord Charles.</p>

<p>"That is a wonderful girl, Charles," she said, with earnest
admiration.</p>

<p>"What, Lenore?" he said. "Rather. Just found it out,
Lady Longford?"</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Impertinence. I have known it all along; but she
astonishes me afresh every day. What a great name she would
have won on the stage. But she will do better as Lady Wyndward."</p>

<p>Lord Charles shook his head, and whistled softly.</p>

<p>"Rather premature that, isn't it?" he said. "Leycester
doesn't seem very keen in that quarter, does he?"</p>

<p>Lady Longford smiled at him and showed her teeth.</p>

<p>"What does it matter how he seems?" she said. "It rests
with her&mdash;with her. You are a nice boy, Charles, but you are
not clever."</p>

<p>"Just exactly what my old schoolmaster used to say before
he birched me," said Lord Charles.</p>

<p>"If you were clever, if you were anything else than unutterably
stupid, you would go and see that Leycester changes his
clothes," snapped the old lady. "I'll be bound he is sitting or
lounging about in those wet things still!"</p>

<p>"A nod's as good as a wink to a blind horse," said Lord
Charles, laughing. "I'll go and do as I am bidden. He will
probably tell me to go and mind my own business, but here goes,"
and he walked off toward the house.</p>

<p>He found Leycester in the hands of his valet, being rapidly
transferred from wet flannels to orthodox morning attire, and
apparently the valet was not having a particularly easy time of
it.</p>

<p>Lord Charles sank into a chair, and watched the performance
with amused interest.</p>

<p>"What's the matter Ley?" he asked, when the man left the
room for a moment. "You'll drive that poor devil into a lunatic
asylum."</p>

<p>"He's so confoundedly slow," answered Leycester, brushing
away at his hair, which the valet had already arranged, and
tugging at a refractory scarf. "I haven't a moment to lose."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>"May one ask whence this haste?" said Lord Charles, with a
smile.</p>

<p>Leycester colored slightly.</p>

<p>"I've half a mind to tell you, Charlie," he said, "but I can't.
I'd better keep it to myself."</p>

<p>"I'm glad of it," retorted Lord Charles. "I'm sure it's some
piece of madness, and if you told me, you'd want me to take a
hand in it."</p>

<p>"But that's just it," said Leycester, with a laugh. "You've
got to take a hand in it, old fellow."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>Leycester nodded and clapped him on the shoulder, with a
musical laugh.</p>

<p>"The best of you, Charlie," he said, "is, that one can always
rely on you."</p>

<p>Lord Charles groaned.</p>

<p>"Don't&mdash;don't, Ley!" he implored. "I know that phrase so
well; you always were wont to use it when there was some particularly
evil piece of business to be done in the old days. Frankly,
I'm a reformed character, and I decline to aid and abet you
in any further madness."</p>

<p>"This isn't madness," said Leycester;&mdash;"oh, keep outside a
moment, Oliver, I don't want you;&mdash;this is not madness, Charlie;
it's the sanest thing I've ever done in my life."</p>

<p>"I dare say."</p>

<p>"It is indeed. Look here! I am going up to London."</p>

<p>"I guessed that. Poor London!"</p>

<p>"Do stop and listen to me&mdash;I haven't a moment to spare. I
want you to do a little delicate service for me."</p>

<p>"I decline. What is it?" retorts Lord Charles, inconsistently.</p>

<p>"It is very simple. I want you to deliver a note for me."</p>

<p>"Oh, come, you know! Won't one of the army of servants,
who devour the land like locusts, serve your turn?"</p>

<p>"No; no none will do but yourself. I want this note delivered,
at once. And I don't want anyone but our two selves to know
anything about it; I don't want it to be carried about in one of
the servant's pockets for an hour or two."</p>

<p>Lord Charles stretched his legs and shook his head.</p>

<p>"Look here, Ley, isn't this rather too 'thin?'" he remonstrated.
"Of course it's to someone of the gentler sex!"</p>

<p>Leycester smiled.</p>

<p>"You are wrong," he said, with a smile. "Where's the
Bradshaw, Oliver!" and he opened the door. "Put out the
note-paper, and then tell them to get a dogcart to take me to the
station."</p>

<p>"You will want me, my lord?"</p>

<p>"No, I am going alone. Look sharp!"</p>

<p>Oliver put out the writing materials and departed, and Leycester
sat down and stared for a moment at the crested paper.</p>

<p>"Shall I go?" asked Lord Charles, ironically.</p>

<p>"No, I don't mean to lose sight of you, old fellow," replied
Leycester. "Sit where you are."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>"Can I help you? I am rather good at amorous epistles,
especially other people's."</p>

<p>"Be quiet."</p>

<p>Then he seized the pen and wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Frank</span>&mdash;I have inclosed a note for Stella. Will
you give it to her when she is alone, and with your own hand!
She will tell you that I have asked her to come with you by the
eleven o'clock train to-morrow. Will you bring her to 24 Bruton
Street? I shall meet you there instead of meeting you at the
station. You see I put it quite simply, and am quite confident
that you will help us. You know our secret, and will stand by
us, will you not? Of course you will come without any luggage,
and without letting anyone divine your intentions."</p>

<p>
"Yours, my dear Frank,<br />
<br />
"<span class="smcap">Leycester</span>."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>This was all very well. It was easy enough to write to the
boy, because he, Leycester, knew that if he had asked Frank to
walk through fire, Frank would do it! But Stella?</p>

<p>A sharp pang of doubt assailed him as he took up the second
sheet of paper. Suppose she should not come!</p>

<p>He got up and strode to and fro the room, his brows knit, the
old look of determination on his face.</p>

<p>"Drop it, Ley," said Lord Charles, quietly.</p>

<p>Leycester stopped, and smiled down at him.</p>

<p>"You don't know what that would mean, Charlie," he said.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I do to&mdash;her, whomsoever it should be."</p>

<p>Then Leycester laughed outright.</p>

<p>"You are on the wrong track this time, altogether," he said,
"quite wrong."</p>

<p>And he sat down and plunged into his letter.</p>

<p>Like the first, it was very short.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Darling</span>,&mdash;Do not be frightened when you read what follows,
and do not hesitate. Think, as you read, that our happiness
depends upon your decision. I want you to come, with
Frank, by the eleven o'clock train to London, whither I am going
now. I want you to take a cab and go to 24 Bruton Street, where
I shall be waiting for you. You know what will happen, my
darling! Before the morrow you and I will have set out on that
long journey through life, hand-in-hand, man and wife. My pen
trembles as I write the words. You will come, Stella? Think!
I know what you will feel&mdash;I know as if I were standing beside
you, how you will tremble, and hesitate, and dread the step; but
you must take it, dearest! Once we are married all will go well
and pleasantly. I cannot wait any longer: why should I? I
have written to Frank, and confided him to your care. Trust
yourself to him, throw all your doubts and fears to the winds.
Think only of my love, and, may I add, your own?"</p>

<p>
"Yours ever,<br />
<br />
"<span class="smcap">Leycester</span>."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>He inclosed Stella's letter in a small envelope, and that, with
Frank's letter, in a larger one, which he addressed to Frank.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">"There</span>," he said, balancing it on his finger and smiling, in
his eager, impatient way&mdash;"there is the missive, Charlie. Read
the superscription thereof."</p>

<p>Lord Charles took the letter gingerly, and shook his head.</p>

<p>"The lad you picked out of the water," he said. "What does
it mean? I wish you'd drop it, Ley."</p>

<p>Leycester shook his head.</p>

<p>"This is the last time I shall ask you to do me a favor, Charlie&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Till the next."</p>

<p>"You mustn't refuse. I want you to give this to the boy. You
will find him down at Etheridge's cottage. You cannot mistake
him; he is a fair, delicate-looking boy, with yellow hair and
blue eyes."</p>

<p>Lord Charles hesitated and looked up with a grave light in his
eyes and a faint flush on his face.</p>

<p>"Ley," he said, in a low voice, "she is too good, far too
good."</p>

<p>Lord Leycester's face flushed.</p>

<p>"If it were any other man, Charlie," he said, looking him full
in the eyes, "I should cut up rough. I tell you that you misunderstand
me&mdash;and you wrong me."</p>

<p>"Then," said Lord Charles, "it is almost a worse case. Ley,
Ley, what are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"I am going to do what no man on earth could prevent me
doing," said Leycester, calmly, but with a fierce light in his eyes.
"Not even you, Charlie."</p>

<p>Lord Charles rose.</p>

<p>"Give me the letter," he said, quietly. "At any rate, I know
when words are useless. Is there anything else? Shall I order
a straight waistcoat? This, mark my words, Ley!&mdash;this&mdash;if it is
what I conjecture it to be&mdash;this is the very maddest thing you
have ever done!"</p>

<p>"It is the very wisest and sanest," responded Leycester. "No,
there is nothing else, Charlie. I may wire for you to-morrow.
If I do, you will come?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I will come," said Lord Charles.</p>

<p>Oliver knocked at the moment.</p>

<p>"The dogcart is waiting, my lord, and there is only just
time."</p>

<p>Leycester and Lord Charles passed out and down the stairs.</p>

<p>The sound of laughter and music floated faintly through the
parted curtains of the drawing-room.</p>

<p>"What shall I say to them?" asked Lord Charles, nodding toward
the room.</p>

<p>Leycester smiled, grimly.</p>

<p>"Tell them," he said, "that I have gone to town <i>on business</i>,"
and he laughed quietly.</p>

<p>Then suddenly he stopped as if a thought had struck him, and
glanced at his watch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>"One moment," he said, and ran lightly up the stairs to Lilian's
room. Her maid met him at the door.</p>

<p>"Her ladyship is asleep," she said.</p>

<p>Leycester hesitated, then he signed to her to open the door,
and entered.</p>

<p>Lady Lilian lay extended on her couch, her eyes closed, a faint,
painful smile on her face.</p>

<p>He stood and looked at her a moment, then he bent and lightly
touched her lips with his.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Lil," he murmured. "You at least will understand."</p>

<p>Then he ran down, putting on his gloves, and had one foot on
the dogcart step when Lady Wyndward came into the hall.</p>

<p>"Leycester," she said, "where are you going?"</p>

<p>He turned and looked at her rather wistfully. Lord Charles
fingered the letter in his pocket, and wished himself in Peru.</p>

<p>"To London, mother," he said.</p>

<p>"Why?" she asked.</p>

<p>It was an unusual question for her, who rarely asked him his
intentions, or the why and wherefore, and he hesitated.</p>

<p>"On business," he said.</p>

<p>She looked at the flushed face and the fire smoldering in his
eyes, and then at Lord Charles, who jingled the money in his
pocket, and whistled softly, with an air of pure abstraction.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she asked, and an unusual look of trouble and
doubt came into her eyes.</p>

<p>"Nothing that need trouble you, mother," he said. "I shall
be back&mdash;" he stopped; when should he be back?&mdash;"soon," he
added.</p>

<p>Then he stooped and kissed her.</p>

<p>Lady Wyndward looked up into his eyes.</p>

<p>"Don't go, Leycester," she murmured.</p>

<p>Almost roughly, in his impatience, he put her arm from him.</p>

<p>"You don't know what you ask," he said. Then in a gentle
tone he said "Good-bye," and sprang into the cart.</p>

<p>The horse rose for a moment, then put his fore feet down and
went off like a rocket under the sharp cut of the whip, and Lady
Wyndward, with a sigh of apprehension, turned to where Lord
Charles had stood.</p>

<p>Had stood; for he had seized the moment of departure to
steal off.</p>

<p>He had helped Leycester in many a mad freak, had stood in
with him in many a wild adventure, which had cost them much
after trouble and no small amount of money, but Lord Charles
had a shrewd suspicion that this which he was asked to assist in
was the climax of all that had gone before. But he felt that he
must do it. As we have said, there were times when words were
of as little use as chaff with Leycester, and this was one of them.</p>

<p>Ruefully, but unshaken in his devotion, he went up-stairs for
his hat and stick, and sauntered down, still wishing that he
could have been in Peru.</p>

<p>"There will be a terrible storm," he muttered. "His people
will cut up rough, and I shall, of course, bear some portion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
the blame; but I don't mind that! It is Ley I am thinking of!
Will it turn out all right?"</p>

<p>He was asking himself the question dolefully and helplessly as
he descended the stairs, when he became conscious of the graceful
form of Lady Lenore standing in the hall and looking up at
him.</p>

<p>She had watched Lord Leycester's departure from the window;
she knew that he was going to town suddenly&mdash;knew that Lord
Charles had been closeted with him, and now only needed to
glance at Lord Charles' rueful face to be convinced that something
had happened. But there was nothing of this in her
smile as she looked up at him, gently fluttering a Japanese fan,
and holding back the trailing skirts with her white, bejeweled
fingers.</p>

<p>Lord Charles started as he saw her.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" he murmured, "if it is as I think, what will she
do?" and with an instinctive dread he felt half inclined to turn
and reascend the stairs, but Lenore was too quick for him.</p>

<p>"We have been looking for you, Lord Charles," she said,
languidly. "Some rash individual has proposed lawn-tennis;
we want you to play."</p>

<p>Lord Charles looked confused. The letter burnt his pocket,
and he knew that he should know no peace until he got rid of it.</p>

<p>"Awfully sorry," he said; "going down to the post-office to
post a letter."</p>

<p>Lady Lenore smiled, and glanced archly at the clock.</p>

<p>"No post till seven," she said; "won't it do after our game?"</p>

<p>"No post!" he said, with affected concern. "Better telegraph,"
he muttered.</p>

<p>"I'll get you a form!" she said, sweetly; "and you can send
it by one of the pages."</p>

<p>"Eh?" he stammered, blushing like a school-boy. "No, don't
trouble; couldn't think of it. After all it doesn't matter."</p>

<p>Then she knew that Leycester had given him some missive,
and she watched him closely. No poorer hand at deception than
poor Charles could possibly be imagined; he felt as if the softly-smiling
velvet eyes could see into his pocket, and his hand closed
over the letter with a movement that she noted instantly.</p>

<p>"It is a letter," she thought, "and it is for her."</p>

<p>And a pang of jealous fire ran through her, but she still looked
up at him with a languid smile.</p>

<p>"Well, are you coming?"</p>

<p>"Of course," he assented, with too palpably-feigned alacrity.
And he ran down the stairs.</p>

<p>She caught up a sun-hat and put it on, and pointed to the
racquets that stood in their stand in the hall. She would not let
him out of her sight for a moment.</p>

<p>"They are all waiting," she said.</p>

<p>He followed her on to the lawn. The group stood playing
with the balls, and waiting impatiently.</p>

<p>Lord Charles looked round helplessly, but he had no time to
think.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>"Shall we play together?" said Lenore. "We know each
other's play so well."</p>

<p>Lord Charles nodded, not too gallantly.</p>

<p>"All right," he said; and as he spoke, his hand wandered to
his pocket.</p>

<p>The game commenced. They were well matched, and presently
Lord Charles, whose two games were billiards and tennis,
got interested. He also got warm, and taking off his coat, flung
it on to the grass.</p>

<p>Lady Lenore glanced at it, and presently, as she changed
places with him, took off her bracelet and threw it on the coat.</p>

<p>"Jewelery is superfluous in tennis," she said, with a soft
laugh. "We mean to win this set, do we not, Lord Charles?"</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>"If you say so," he replied. "You always win if you mean
it."</p>

<p>"Nearly always," she said, with a significant smile.</p>

<p>All the four were enthusiasts, if Lenore could be called enthusiastic
about anything, and the game was hotly contested. The
sun poured down upon their faces, but they played on, pausing
occasionally for the usual squabble over the scoring; the servants
brought claret and champagne cup; Lady Wyndward and the
earl came out and sat in the shade, watching.</p>

<p>"We shall win!" exclaimed Lord Charles, the perspiration
running down his face, his whole soul absorbed in the work, the
letter entirely forgotten.</p>

<p>"I think so," said Lady Lenore, but as she spoke she missed a
long ball.</p>

<p>"How did you manage that?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"It is the racquet," she said, apologetically. "It is a little too
heavy. It always gets too heavy when I have been playing a
little while. I wish I had my other one."</p>

<p>"I'll send for it," he said, eagerly.</p>

<p>"No, no," she said. "They won't know which it is&mdash;they
never do."</p>

<p>"I'll go for it, then," he said, gracefully. "Can't lose the
game, you know."</p>

<p>"Will you?" she said, eagerly. "It stands on the hall table&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know," he said. "Wait a moment!" he called out to the
others, and bolted off.</p>

<p>Lenore looked after him for a moment, then she glanced
round. The other two were standing discussing the game; the
on-lookers were gathered round the champagne cup. Lady
Wyndward was lost in thought, with eyes bent to the ground.</p>

<p>The beauty's eyes flashed, and her face grew slightly pale.
Her eyes wandered to the coat, she hesitated for a moment, then
she walked leisurely toward it and stooped down and picked up
the bracelet. As she did so she turned the coat over with her
other hand, and drew the note from the pocket.</p>

<p>A glance put her in possession of the address, and she returned
the note to its place, and strolled back to the tennis-court<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
with an unmoved countenance; but her heart beat fast, as her
acute brain seized upon the problem and worked it out.</p>

<p>A note to the boy! A letter which can be confided to no less
trusty a hand than Lord Charles! Leycester's sudden departure
for London! Lord Charles's confusion and embarrassment! Secresy
and mystery! What does it mean?</p>

<p>A presentiment seemed to possess her that a critical moment
had arrived. She seemed to feel, by instinct, that some movement
was in progress by which she should lose all chance of securing
Leycester.</p>

<p>Her heart beat fast, so fast that the delicate veins in her white
hands throbbed; but she still smiled, and even glided across to
Lady Wyndward, who sat thoughtfully in the shade, looking at
the tennis, but thinking of Leycester.</p>

<p>She looked up as the tall graceful figure approached.</p>

<p>"You are tiring yourself to death, my dear," she said, with
a sigh.</p>

<p>"No, I am enjoying it. What is the matter?"</p>

<p>Lady Wyndward looked at her candidly.</p>

<p>"I am troubled about my only troublous subject. Leycester
has gone off again."</p>

<p>"I know," was the quiet answer.</p>

<p>"Where, I know not; he said London. I don't know why I
should feel particularly uneasy, but I do. There is some plot
afoot between Lord Charles and him."</p>

<p>"I know it," smiled Lenore, "Lord Charles is not good at
keeping a secret. He makes a very bad conspirator."</p>

<p>"He would do anything for Leycester, any mad thing," sighed
Lady Wyndward.</p>

<p>The beautiful face smiled down at her thoughtfully for a moment,
then Lenore said:</p>

<p>"Do you think you could keep Lord Charles on the tennis-lawn,
here, for half-an-hour?"</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Lady Wyndward. "Yes, I think so."</p>

<p>"Do so, then," replied Lady Lenore, "I will tell you why afterward.
Lord Charles is very clever, no doubt, but I think I
am cleverer, don't you?"</p>

<p>"I think you are all that is good and beautiful, my dear,"
sighed the anxious mother.</p>

<p>"Dear Lady Wyndward," softly murmured the beauty.
"Well, keep him chained here for half-an-hour, and leave the
rest to me. I am not apt to ask unreasonable requests, dear."</p>

<p>"No. I'll do anything you want or tell me," replied Lady
Wyndward. "I am full of anxious fears, Lenore. Do you
know what it means?"</p>

<p>Lady Lenore hesitated.</p>

<p>"No. I do not know, but I think I can guess. See, here he
comes."</p>

<p>Lord Charles came striding along, swinging the racquet.</p>

<p>"Here you are, Lady Lenore. Is that the right one?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "but I can't play any longer. I am so sorry,
but I have hurt my hand. No, it's a mere nothing. I am going
in to bathe it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, it's an awful pity," said Lord Charles. "I am very sorry.
Well, the game is over. We must play it out another day. I'm
going down to the village, and I'll call at the chemist's for a
lotion. I expect you have sprained your hand." And suddenly,
reminded of his mission, he was walking toward his coat, but
Lenore glanced at the countess, and Lady Wyndward stopped
him with a word.</p>

<p>"We can't have the game stopped," she said. "Here is Miss
Dalton dying to play, aren't you, dear?" she said, turning to a
young girl who had been watching the game. "Yes, I knew it.
You must take her in place of Lenore. Go on, my dear."</p>

<p>Miss Dalton, or Miss any one else, would as soon have thought
of disobeying Lady Wyndward as jumping off the top story of
the Hall, and the girl rose obediently and took the racquet which
Lenore smilingly held out to her.</p>

<p>Then what did Lenore do? She walked deliberately to Lord
Charles' coat, dropped her bracelet on it, stooped, picked up the
bracelet, and abstracted the letter, and concealing the latter in
her sunshade, glided toward the house.</p>

<p>With fast beating heart she gained her own room and locked
the door.</p>

<p>Then she drew the letter from her sunshade and eyed it as a
thief might eye a safe in which lay the treasure he coveted.</p>

<p>Then she rang the bell and ordered some hot water.</p>

<p>"I have sprained my wrist," she said, in explanation, "and I
want the water very hot."</p>

<p>The maid brought the water and offered to bathe the wrist, but
Lady Lenore sent her away, and locked the door again.</p>

<p>Then she held the envelope over the steaming jug and watched
the paper part.</p>

<p>Even then she hesitated, even as the note lay open to her.</p>

<p>This which she contemplated doing was the meanest act a
mortal could be guilty of, and hitherto she had scorned all baseness
and meanness. But love is stronger than a sense of right
and wrong in some women, and it overcame her scruples.</p>

<p>With a sudden compression of the lips she drew out the note
and read it, and as she read it her face paled. Every word of
endearment stabbed her straight to the heart, and made her
writhe.</p>

<p>"My darling!" she murmured; "my darling! How he must
love her!" and for a moment she sat with the letter in her hand
overcome by jealousy and misery. Then, with a start, she
roused herself. Let come what might, the thing should not
happen. This girl should not be Leycester's wife.</p>

<p>But how to prevent it? She sat and thought as the precious
moments ticked themselves out into eternity, and suddenly she
remembered Jasper Adelstone&mdash;remembered him with a scornful
contempt, but still remembered him.</p>

<p>"Any port in a storm," she said; "a drowning man clings to
a straw, and he is no straw."</p>

<p>Then she inclosed the letter in its envelope, and taking out
the writing-case wrote on a scented sheet of paper: "Meet me
by the weir at eight o'clock." This she inclosed in an envelope,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
and addressed to Jasper Adelstone, Esq., and with the two notes
in her hand returned to the tennis lawn.</p>

<p>They were still playing&mdash;Lord Charles absorbed in the game,
and once more quite oblivious of the letter.</p>

<p>She stood and watched them for a minute; then she went and
sank down beside the jacket, and hiding the movements with
her sunshade, restored Leycester's letter to its place.</p>

<p>A few minutes afterward the single line she had written was
on its way to Jasper.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">"I am</span> Frank Etheridge," said Frank, looking up at Lord Charles,
as the latter stopped at the little gate in the lane. "Yes, I am
Frank Etheridge." And as he repeated the sentence, a shy,
almost a timid, apprehensive expression came into his eyes.</p>

<p>"All right," said Lord Charles, looking round with a most inconsistent
look of caution on his frank, handsome face. "Then
I have a letter for you."</p>

<p>"For me!" said Frank, and his face paled.</p>

<p>Lord Charles eyed him with astonishment.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" he said. "What are you alarmed at?
I am not a bailiff&mdash;I am only Mercury." And he chuckled at the
joke at his own expense. "I have a letter for you&mdash;from my
friend Lord Leycester."</p>

<p>Frank's face lit up, and he held out his hand promptly.</p>

<p>Lord Charles took the letter from his pocket and turned it over
quickly.</p>

<p>"It's got tumbled and creased," he said. "Fact is, I ought to
have given it to you an hour or two ago, but I was led on to
tennis and forgot it."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's all right," said Frank, eagerly. "I am very much
obliged, sir. Won't you come in? My father and my cousin
Stella will be glad to see you."</p>

<p>But Lord Charles shook his head, and glanced at the pretty
cottage, with its air of peace which surrounded it, with something
like a pang of remorse.</p>

<p>"I do hope this will all turn out right," he thought. "Leycester
means well, but he is as likely as not to bungle it in one of
his mad humors!" Then aloud, he said, "No, I won't come
in, but&mdash;&mdash;" he hesitated a moment, "but will you tell your
cousin&mdash;Miss Etheridge, that&mdash;that&mdash;&mdash;" Simple Lord Charles
hesitated and took off his hat, and stared at the maker's name
for a moment. "Well, look here, you know, if either you or
she want any assistance&mdash;want a friend, you know&mdash;come to me.
I shall be at the Hall. You understand, don't you? My name
is Guildford."</p>

<p>Frank nodded, and took Lord Charles's extended hand.</p>

<p>"Thank you, very much, Lord Guildford," he said.</p>

<p>And Lord Charles, with another rather rueful glance at the
cottage, retired.</p>

<p>Frank tore open the envelope and devoured the contents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
of the short and pregnant note, then he went in search of
Stella.</p>

<p>She was sitting at the organ, not playing, but touching the
keys with her fingers, a rapt look of meditation on her face.
Mr. Etheridge was hard at work making the best of the golden
evening light.</p>

<p>Stella started as the boy came in, and would have spoken, but
he put his finger to his lips and beckoned her.</p>

<p>They both passed out without attracting the attention of the
absorbed artist, and Frank drew Stella into the garden, and to
a small arbor at the further end. She looked at his flushed, excited
face with a smile.</p>

<p>"What does this mysterious conduct mean, Frank?" she
asked.</p>

<p>He put his arm round her and drew her to a seat.</p>

<p>"I've got something for you, Stella," he said. "What will
you give me for it? It is worth&mdash;well, untold treasure, but I'll
be satisfied with a kiss."</p>

<p>She bent and kissed his forehead.</p>

<p>"Of course it is nothing," she said, with a laugh; but as he
took the letter from his pocket and held it up her face changed.
"What is it Frank?"</p>

<p>He put the letter in her hand, and, with an instinctive delicacy
got up and walked away.</p>

<p>"Read it, Stel," he said. "I'll be back directly."</p>

<p>Stella took the letter and opened it. When Frank came back
she was sitting with the open letter in her hand, her face
very pale, her eyes filled with a strange light.</p>

<p>"Well!" he said.</p>

<p>"Oh Frank," she breathed, "I cannot do it! I cannot!"</p>

<p>"Cannot!" he exclaimed. "You must! Why, Stella, of
what are you afraid? I shall be with you."</p>

<p>She shook her head slowly.</p>

<p>"It is not that. I am not afraid," and there was a touch of
pride in her voice. "Do you think I am afraid of&mdash;of Leycester?"</p>

<p>"No!" he retorted. "I should think not! I would trust
him, if I were in your place, to the end of the world. I know
what he has asked you to do, Stel, and you&mdash;we&mdash;must do it!"</p>

<p>Stella looked at him.</p>

<p>"And uncle!"</p>

<p>The boy colored, but his eyes met hers steadily.</p>

<p>"Well, it will not hurt him! He will not mind. He likes Lord
Leycester, and when we come back and tell him he will be only
too grateful that it is all over without any fuss or trouble. You
know that, Stel!"</p>

<p>She did know it, but her heart still misgave her. With a touch
of color in her pale face at the thought of what "it" meant, she
said gently. "He has been a father to me, Frank; ah, you do
not know!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do," he said, shortly; "but a husband is more than a
father, Stella. And my father won't be any the less fond of you
because you are Lady Leycester Wyndward!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, hush&mdash;hush!" breathed Stella, glancing round as if she
feared the very shrubs and flowers might hear.</p>

<p>Frank threw himself beside her, and laying his hand on her
arm, looked up into her beautiful face with eager entreaty.</p>

<p>"You will go, Stel; you will do what he asks!" and Stella
looked down at him with gentle wonder. Leycester himself
could not have pleaded his own cause more earnestly.</p>

<p>"Don't you see, Stel?" he said, answering her look, for she had
not spoken; "I would do anything for him&mdash;anything! He
risked his life for me, but it is not only that; it is because he has
treated me so&mdash;so&mdash;well, I can't explain; but I would do anything
for him, Stella. I&mdash;I love you! you know; but&mdash;but I feel
as if I should <i>hate</i> you if you refused to do what he asks!"</p>

<p>Stella's eyes glistened; it made her heart throb to hear the
boy's championship of the man she loved.</p>

<p>"Besides," he continued; "why should you hesitate? For it is
for your own happiness&mdash;for the happiness of us all! Think! you
will be the future Countess of Wyndward, the mistress of the
Hall."</p>

<p>Stella looked at him reproachfully.</p>

<p>"Frank!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know you don't care about that, neither do I much,
but other people will. My father will be glad&mdash;he could not
help being so, and then you will be safe."</p>

<p>"Safe? What do you mean?" asked Stella.</p>

<p>He hesitated. Then he looked up at her with an angry resentful
flash in his blue eyes.</p>

<p>"Stel! I was thinking of that fellow Adelstone. I don't like
him! I hate him, in fact; and I hate him all the more because
he has set his mind upon having you."</p>

<p>Stella smiled and shook her head.</p>

<p>"Oh, of course you can't see any harm in him. It's quite
right you shouldn't&mdash;you are a girl, and don't know the world;
but I know something of men, and I say that Jasper Adelstone
is not a man to be trusted."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> don't like him," said Stella, in a low tone, "but I am
quite 'safe,' as you call it, without marry&mdash;without doing what
you and Leycester wish."</p>

<p>"I don't know," he muttered, gloomily. "At any rate, you
<i>would</i> be safe then, and&mdash;and, Stella, you <i>must</i> go. See, now,
Leycester has trusted you to me&mdash;has placed this in my hands.
It is as if he said, 'I saved your life&mdash;you promised to help me.
Here is something to do&mdash;do it!' And I will. You will go.
Think, Stel!&mdash;A few short hours and you will be Lady Leycester!"</p>

<p>She did think of it, and her heart beat tumultuously.</p>

<p>Yes, she would be safe not only from Jasper Adelstone, but
from Lady Lenore, whom she feared more than she did twenty
Jasper Adelstones. Leycester would be her own, her very own;
and though she did not care much for the Wyndward coronet,
she did care for him.</p>

<p>She covered her face with her hands, and sat quite motionless
for a few minutes, the boy watching her eagerly, impatiently;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
then she dropped her hands, and looked down at him with the
quiet, grave, resolute smile which he knew so well.</p>

<p>"Yes, Frank, I will do it," was all she said.</p>

<p>He kissed her hand gratefully.</p>

<p>"Think it is Lord Leycester thanking you, Stel," he whispered.
"And now for the preparations. You must pack a small
bag, and I will do the same, and then I must take them down
the lane and hide them; it wouldn't do to go out of the house in
the morning with the bags in our hands&mdash;Mrs. Penfold would
raise the neighborhood, and we must stroll out as if we were
strolling down to the river. But there!"&mdash;he broke off, for he
saw Stella's face, always so eloquent, beginning to show signs of
irresolution&mdash;"leave it all to me&mdash;I'll see to it! Lord Leycester
knew he could trust me."</p>

<p>Stella sat for a few minutes in silence, thinking of the old man
who had received her in her helplessness, who had loved and
treated her as a daughter, and whom she was about to deceive.</p>

<p>Her heart smote her keenly, but still Frank had spoken the
truth&mdash;husband was more than father, and Leycester would be
her husband.</p>

<p>She stooped and kissed the boy.</p>

<p>"I must go in now, Frank," she said. "Do not say any more.
I will go, but I cannot talk of it."</p>

<p>She went in; the dusk was falling, and the old man stood beside
his easel eying it wistfully.</p>

<p>She went and drew him away.</p>

<p>"No more to-night, uncle," she said, in tones that quivered
dangerously. "Come and sit down; come and sit and watch the
river, as you sat the day I came; do you remember?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes, my dear," he murmured, sinking into the chair,
and taking the pipe she filled for him. "I remember the day.
It was a happy day for me; it would be a miserable day the day
you left me, Stella!"</p>

<p>Stella hid her face on his shoulder, and her arm went round
his neck.</p>

<p>He smoothed her hair in silence.</p>

<p>"Where is Frank?" he asked, dreamily.</p>

<p>"In the garden. Shall I call him? Dear Frank! He is a
dear boy, uncle!"</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered, musingly, then he roused slightly. "Yes,
Frank is a good boy. He has changed greatly; I have to thank
you for that too, my dear!"</p>

<p>"Me, uncle?"</p>

<p>The old man nodded, his eyes fixed on the distant lights of the
Hall.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is your influence, Stella. I have watched and noticed
it. There is no one in the world who has so much power over
him. Yes, he is a good boy now, thanks to you!"</p>

<p>What could she say? Her heart throbbed quickly. Her influence!
and she was now going to help him to deceive his
father&mdash;for her sake!</p>

<p>In silence she hid her face, and a tear rolled down her cheek
and fell upon his arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>"Uncle," she murmured, "you know I love you! You know
that! You will always remember and believe that, whatever&mdash;whatever
happens."</p>

<p>He nodded all unsuspectingly, and smiled.</p>

<p>"What is going to happen, Stella?" he asked; but even as he
asked his gaze grew dreamy and absent, and she, looking in his
face, was silent.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As the clock struck the hour Jasper Adelstone threaded his
way through the wood, and stood concealed behind the oak by
the weir.</p>

<p>He had not spent a pleasant time since the avowal of his love
to Stella, and her refusal. Most men would have been daunted
and discouraged at such a refusal, so scornfully, so decidedly
given, but Jasper Adelstone was not the sort to be so easily
balked. Opposition only served to whet his appetite and harden
his resolution.</p>

<p>He had set his mind upon gaining Stella; he had set his mind
upon balking Lord Leycester, and he was not to be turned from
his purpose by her refusing his addresses or the petulance of the
boy who had chosen to insult and set him at defiance.</p>

<p>But he had passed a bad time of it, and was meditating a renewal
of the attack when Lady Lenore's note was brought to
him. Although it bore no signature, he knew from whence it
came, and he knew that something had happened of importance
or she would not have sent for him.</p>

<p>Another man might have vented his spite, and taken revenge
for the haughty insolence displayed by her on their former
meeting, by keeping her waiting, but Jasper Adelstone was not
altogether a mean man, and certainly not such a fool as to risk
an advantage for the sake of gratifying a little private malice.</p>

<p>He was punctual to the minute, and stood watching the weir
and the path by turns, with a face that was naturally calm and
self-possessed, though in reality he was burning with impatience.</p>

<p>Presently he heard the rustle of a dress, and saw her coming
swiftly and gracefully through the trees. She wore a dark dress
of some soft stuff, that clung to her supple figure and awoke for
a moment his sense of admiration, but only for a moment; bad
as he was, he was faithful and of single purpose; he had no
thought of anyone but Stella. If Lady Lenore had laid her rank
and her wealth at his feet he would have turned from them.</p>

<p>Lenore came down the path, neither looking to the right nor
the left, but straight before her, her head held up haughtily and
her whole gait as full of pride and conscious power as if she
were treading the floor of a London ball-room. Even in doing
a mean thing, she could not do it meanly. Arrived at the weir
she stood for a moment looking down at the water, her gloved
hand resting on the wooden sill, and Jasper watching her, could
not but wonder at her calm self-possession.</p>

<p>"And yet," he thought, "she has more at stake than I. She
has a coronet&mdash;and the man she loves," and the thought gave
him courage, as he came out and stood before her, raising his
hat.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>




<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">She</span> turned and inclined her head haughtily, and waited, as if
for him to speak, but Jasper remained silent. She had sent for
him; he was here!</p>

<p>At last she spoke.</p>

<p>"You received my note, Mr. Adelstone?"</p>

<p>"I am here," he said, with a slight smile.</p>

<p>She bit her lip, her pride revolting at his presence, at his very
tone.</p>

<p>"I sent for you," she said, after a pause, and in the coldest
tone, "because I have some information which I thought would
interest you."</p>

<p>"Your ladyship is very good," he said.</p>

<p>"And because," she went on, scorning to accept his thanks,
"I thought you might be of service."</p>

<p>He inclined his head. He would not meet her half way&mdash;would
not help her. Let her tell him why she had sent for him,
and he would throw himself into the case, not till then.</p>

<p>"The last time that we met you said words which I am not
likely to have forgotten."</p>

<p>"I have not forgotten them," he said, "and I am prepared to
stand by them."</p>

<p>"You profess to be willing&mdash;to be eager to prevent a certain
occurrence?"</p>

<p>"If you mean the marriage of Lord Leycester and Stel&mdash;Miss
Etheridge, I am more than willing; I am determined to prevent it!"</p>

<p>"You speak with great confidence," she said.</p>

<p>"I am always confident, Lady Lenore," he said. "It is by
confidence that great things are achieved; this is only a small
one."</p>

<p>"And yet it may be beyond your power to achieve," she said,
scornfully.</p>

<p>"I think not," he retorted, quietly and gravely.</p>

<p>"Be that as it may," she said, "I have come here this evening
to place in your hands a piece of information respecting the girl
in whom you profess to take an interest."</p>

<p>The blood came to his pale face, and his eyes gleamed with
sudden resentment.</p>

<p>"By 'the girl,' do you refer to Miss Stella Etheridge?" he said,
quietly. "If so, permit me to remind your ladyship that she is
a lady!"</p>

<p>Lady Lenore made a gesture of haughty indifference.</p>

<p>"Call her what you please," she said, coldly, insolently. "I
did refer to her."</p>

<p>"And to the man in whom you take an interest?" he said,
with an insolence that matched her own.</p>

<p>The dark red flamed in her face, and she looked at him.</p>

<p>"That is a side of the question which we will not enter upon,
if you please, Mr. Adelstone," she said.</p>

<p>"I am to understand, then," he said, with quiet scorn, "that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
you came here this evening by your own appointment to do me
a service. Is that so?"</p>

<p>He had roused her at last.</p>

<p>"Understand, think what you will," she said, in a low, strange
voice; "let there be no parley between us. I wanted to see you
and sent for you, and you are here, let that suffice. You wish
to prevent the marriage of Lord Leycester and <i>the lady</i> whom
we saw him with at this spot. You speak confidently of your
power to do so; you will have a speedy opportunity of testing
that power, for Lord Leycester intends marrying her to-morrow,
or at latest the next day."</p>

<p>He did not start, neither did he turn pale, but he looked at her
calmly, fixedly; she knew that her shaft had told home, and
she stood and watched and enjoyed.</p>

<p>"How do you know this?" he asked, quietly, in a very low
voice.</p>

<p>She paused. It was a bitter humiliation to have to admit to
this man, whom she regarded as the dust under her feet, that she,
the Lady Lenore, had stooped so low as to steal and read a letter
addressed to another person, and that person her rival&mdash;but it
had to be admitted.</p>

<p>"I know it because he wrote and made arrangements for her
flight and their clandestine meeting."</p>

<p>"How do you know it?" he asked, and his voice was dry and
harsh.</p>

<p>She paused a moment.</p>

<p>"Because I saw the letter," she said, eying him defiantly.</p>

<p>He smiled&mdash;even in his agony and fury he smiled at her humiliation.</p>

<p>"You have indeed done much in my service," he said, with a
sneer.</p>

<p>"Yours!" came fiercely to her lips; then she made a gesture
of contempt, as if he were beneath her resentment.</p>

<p>"You saw the letter," he said. "What were the arrangements?
When and where was she to meet him? Curse him!"
he ground out between his teeth.</p>

<p>"She is to go to London by the eleven o'clock train to-morrow,
and he will meet her and take her to 24 Bruton Street," she said,
curtly.</p>

<p>He choked back the oath that came to his lips.</p>

<p>"Meet him, and alone!" he muttered, the sweat breaking out
on his forehead, his lips writhing.</p>

<p>"No, not alone; a boy, her cousin, is to accompany them."</p>

<p>"Ah!" he said, and a malignant smile curled his lips; "I can
scotch that small snake; but him&mdash;Lord Leycester!" and his
hands clinched.</p>

<p>He took a turn in the narrow path, and then came back to her.</p>

<p>"And afterward?" he asked. "What is to follow?"</p>

<p>She shook her head with contemptuous indifference, and leant
against the wooden rail, looking down at the bubbling, seething
water.</p>

<p>"I do not know. I imagine, as the boy accompanies her, that
he will get a special license, and&mdash;marry her. But, perhaps"&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
she glanced round at his white face with a malicious smile&mdash;"perhaps
the boy is a mere blind, and Lord Leycester will
dispose of him."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"Then," she said, slowly. "Well, Lord Leycester's character
is tolerably well known; in all probability he will not find it
necessary to make the girl&mdash;I beg your pardon! the young lady&mdash;the
future Countess of Wyndward."</p>

<p>She had gone too far. As the cruel, fearful words left her lips
in all their biting, merciless scorn and contempt, he sprang upon
her and seized her by the arm.</p>

<p>Her feet slipped, and she turned and clung to him, half her
body hanging over the white foaming water.</p>

<p>For a moment they stood there, his gleaming eyes threatening
death into hers, then, with a sudden long breath as if he had
mastered his murderous impulse, he stepped backward, and
drew her with him into safety.</p>

<p>"Take care!" he said, wiping the perspiration from his white
forehead with a trembling hand. "Your ladyship nearly went
too far! You forget that I love this girl, as you call her, though
she is an angel of light and a star of nobility beside you, who
stoop to open letters and utter slander! Take care!"</p>

<p>She eyed him with a cruel scorn in her eyes and on her lips,
that were white and shamed.</p>

<p>"You would murder me," she said.</p>

<p>He laughed a low, dry laugh.</p>

<p>"I would murder anyone who spoke of her as you spoke," he
said, with quiet intensity. "So be warned, my lady. For the
future, teach your proud temper respect when it touches her
name. Besides"&mdash;and he made a gesture as of contempt&mdash;"it
was a foolish lie. You know that he intended nothing of the
kind; you know that she is too pure even for his dastardly heart
to compass her destruction. I imagine it is that which makes
you hate her so. Is it not? No matter. Now that you are
warned, and that you have learnt that I, Jasper Adelstone, am
no mere slave to dance or writhe at your pleasure, we will return
to the purport of the meeting. Will you not sit down?" and he
pointed to the weir stage.</p>

<p>She was trembling from sheer physical weakness, combined with
impotent rage and fury, but she would rather have died than
obey him.</p>

<p>"Go on," she said. "What have you to say?"</p>

<p>"This," he returned. "That this marriage must be prevented,
and that Miss Etheridge's good name must be preserved and
protected. I can prevent this marriage even now, at the last
hour. I will do so, on the condition that you give me your
promise that you will never while life lasts speak of this. I have
not much fear that you will do so; even you will hesitate before
you proclaim to a third person your capability of opening
another person's letters!"</p>

<p>"I promise," she said, coldly. "And how will you prevent
this? You do not know the man against whom you intend to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
pit yourself. Beware of him! Lord Leycester is a man who
will not be trifled with."</p>

<p>"Thanks" he retorted. "You are very kind to warn me,
especially as you would very much like to see me at Lord Leycester's
feet. But I need no warning. I deal with her, not with
him. How, is my affair."</p>

<p>She rose.</p>

<p>"I will go," she said, coldly.</p>

<p>"Stay," he said; "you have got your part to do!"</p>

<p>She eyed him with haughty surprise.</p>

<p>"I?"</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"Let me think for a moment," and he took a turn on the path,
then he came back and stood beside her.</p>

<p>"This is your part," he said, in low, distinct tones, "and remember
that the stake you are playing for is as great and greater
than mine. I am playing for love, you are playing for love,
and for wealth, and rank, and influence, all that makes life
worth living for, for such as you."</p>

<p>"You are insolent!"</p>

<p>"No, I am simply candid. Between us two there can be no
further by-play or concealment. If she obeys this command of
his, and&mdash;" and he groaned&mdash;"I fear she will obey it! they
will start by the eleven o'clock train, and he will await them at
the London terminus. They must start by that train but they
must not reach the terminus."</p>

<p>She started, and eyed him in the dusk.</p>

<p>He smiled sardonically.</p>

<p>"No, I do not take extreme measures until they are absolutely
necessary, Lady Lenore. It is an easy matter to prevent them
reaching the terminus, a very easy one&mdash;it is only a matter of a
forged note."</p>

<p>Her lips moved.</p>

<p>"A forged note?"</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes; having bidden her take a decided course, he must write
and alter his instructions. Do you not understand?"</p>

<p>She was silent, watching him.</p>

<p>"A note must come from him&mdash;it will be better to write to
the boy, because he is not familiar with Lord Leycester's
hand-writing&mdash;telling them to get out at the station before
London, at Vauxhall. They are to get out and go to the entrance,
where they will find a brougham, which will take them to him.
You understand?"</p>

<p>"I understand," she said. "But the note&mdash;who is to forge&mdash;write
it?"</p>

<p>He smiled at her with malignant triumph.</p>

<p>"You."</p>

<p>"I?"</p>

<p>He smiled again.</p>

<p>"Yes, you. Who so well able to do it? You are an adept at
manipulating correspondence, remember, my lady!"</p>

<p>She winced, and her eyes blazed under their lowered lids.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>"You know his hand-writing, you can easily obtain access to
his writing materials; the paper and envelope will bear the
Wyndward crest. The note can be delivered by a servant from
the Hall."</p>

<p>She was silent, overwhelmed by the power of his cunning,
and a reluctant admiration of his resource and ready ingenuity
took possession of her. As he had said, he was no slave&mdash;no
puppet to be worked at will.</p>

<p>"You see," he said, after allowing a moment for his scheme
to sink into her brain, "the note will be delivered almost at the
last moment, at the carriage door, as the train starts. You will
do it?"</p>

<p>She turned away with a last effort.</p>

<p>"I will not!"</p>

<p>"Good," he said. "Then I will find some other means.
Stella Etheridge shall never be Lord Leycester's wife; but
neither shall a certain Lady Lenore Beauchamp."</p>

<p>She turned upon him with a scornful smile.</p>

<p>"To-morrow, when he stands balked and discomfited, filled
with impotent rage, and sees me carry her off before his
eyes, I will give him something to console him. This little
note to wit, and a full account of <i>your</i> share in this conspiracy
which robs him of his prey."</p>

<p>"You will not dare!" she breathed, her head erect, her eyes
blazing.</p>

<p>"Dare!" and he laughed. "What is there to dare? Come,
my lady! It is not my fault if you remain in ignorance of
the nature of the man you are dealing with. Work with me
and I will serve you, desert me&mdash;for it would be desertion&mdash;and
I will thwart you. Which is it to be? You will write and
send the note!"</p>

<p>She moved her hand.</p>

<p>"What else?"</p>

<p>A gleam of triumph shot from his small eyes. He thought
for a moment.</p>

<p>"Only this" he said, "and it is your welfare that I am now
thinking of. When Lord Leycester returns from his fruitless
errand, he will be in a fit state for consolation. You can give
it to him. I have greatly over-rated the ingenuity and tact of
Lady Lenore Beauchamp if that tact and ingenuity does not enable
her to bring Lord Leycester Wyndward to her feet before
the month has passed."</p>

<p>Pale and humiliated, but still meeting his sneering contemptuous
gaze with steadfast eyes, she inclined her head.</p>

<p>"Is that all?"</p>

<p>"That is all," he said. "I can rely on you. Yes, I think&mdash;I
am sure I can. After all, our interests are mutual!"</p>

<p>She gathered her shawl round her, and moved toward the
path.</p>

<p>He raised his hat.</p>

<p>"When next we meet, Lady Lenore, it will be as strangers who
have nothing in common. The past will have been wiped out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
from both our minds and our lives. I shall be the chosen husband
of Stella Etheridge and you will be the Lady Trevor and
future Countess of Wyndward. I never prophesy in vain, my
lady; I never prophesied more confidently than I do now. Good-night."</p>

<p>She did not return his greeting&mdash;scarcely looked at him, but
glided quietly into the darkness.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Sleep</span> kept afar off from Stella's eyelids that night. The
momentous morrow loomed before her, at one moment filling
her with a nameless dread, at another suffusing her whole being
with an equally nameless ecstasy.</p>

<p>Could it be possible that to-morrow&mdash;in a few hours&mdash;she would
be Leycester's wife? There was enough in the reflection to
banish sleep for a week.</p>

<p>Let us do her justice. Love and not ambition was the sentiment
that moved and agitated her. It was not the thought of
the title and the wealth which awaited her, not the future
Wyndward coronet which set her trembling and her heart throbbing,
but the reflection that Leycester, her lover, her ideal of all
that was great and noble, and manfully beautiful, would be her
own, all her own.</p>

<p>At an early hour she heard Frank wandering up and down
outside her door, and at last he knocked.</p>

<p>"Are you getting up, Stel?" he asked, in a whisper.</p>

<p>Stella opened the door and stood before him in her plain stuff
dress, which Frank was wont to declare became her better than
the satins and silks of a duchess, and he looked up at her with an
admiring nod.</p>

<p>"That's right!" he said. "I've been up ages. I've taken my
bag and hidden it in the lane. Is yours ready?"</p>

<p>She gave him a small handbag&mdash;gave it with a certain reluctance
that hung about her still; but he took it eagerly.</p>

<p>"That's a good girl! It isn't too big! I can carry both of
them. Keep up your spirits, Stel!" he added, smiling encouragingly,
as he stole off with the bag.</p>

<p>The warning was not altogether unnecessary, for Stella, when
she came down stairs and found the old man standing before his
easel, his white locks stirred by the light wind which came
through the open window, felt very near tears.</p>

<p>It was a great blot on her happiness that she could not go to
him and throw her arms round his neck and say, "Uncle, to-day
I am to be married to Lord Leycester; give me your blessing!"</p>

<p>As it was she went up to him and kissed him with more than
her usual caressing tenderness.</p>

<p>"How quietly happy you always are, dear," she said, with a
little tremulous undertone in her voice. "You will always be
happy while you have your art, uncle."</p>

<p>"Eh!" he said, patting her arm, and letting his eye wander
over her face. "Yes, art is long, life is short, Stella. Happy!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
yes; but I like to have you as well as my art. Two good things
in life should make a man content."</p>

<p>"You have Frank, too," she said, as she poured out his coffee
and drew him to the table.</p>

<p>Frank came in and breakfast proceeded. They were all very
silent; the old man rapt in dreams, as usual&mdash;the two young ones
stilled by the weight of their guilty secret.</p>

<p>Once or twice Frank pressed Stella's feet under the table encouragingly,
and when they rose and Stella went to the window,
he followed her and whispered:</p>

<p>"Good news, Stel!"</p>

<p>She turned her eyes upon him.</p>

<p>"I've just learned that the fellow Adelstone has gone to London.
I was half afraid that he might turn up at the last moment
and spoil our plans; but the groom at the vicarage, whom I just
met, told me that Jasper Adelstone had been summoned to London
on business."</p>

<p>Stella felt a sense of relief, though she smiled.</p>

<p>"Mr. Adelstone is your <i>bête noire</i>, Frank," she said.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"I'd rather have his room than his company, any day." Then,
after a pause, he added, "I don't think we'd better start together,
Stel. I'll walk on directly, and you can follow. Whatever
you do, avoid a collision with Mrs. Penfold; her eyes are
sharp, and there's something in your face this morning that
would set her curiosity on the <i>qui vive</i>."</p>

<p>A few moments afterward he left the room, and Stella was
left alone. Her heart beat fast, and, try as she would, she could
not keep her eyes from the silent, patient figure at the easel, and
at last she went up and stood beside him.</p>

<p>"You seem restless this morning, my child," he said. "Meditating
any secret crime?" And he smiled.</p>

<p>Stella started guiltily.</p>

<p>"I wonder what you would say, what you would think,
uncle," she murmured, with a little laugh that bordered on the
hysterical, "if I were to do anything wrong&mdash;if I were to deceive
you in anything?"</p>

<p>He stepped back to look at his picture.</p>

<p>"I should say, my dear, that the last shred of faith and trust
in women to which I have clung had given way, and landed me
in despair."</p>

<p>"No, no! Don't say that!" she said, quickly.</p>

<p>He looked at her with a sad smile.</p>

<p>"My dear," he answered, "I do not speak without cause.
I have reason to be incredulous as to the faith and honesty
of women. But my trust in you is as limitless as the sky
yonder. I don't think you will destroy it, Stella," and he
turned to his picture again.</p>

<p>The tears came into Stella's eyes, and she clung to his arm
in silent remorse.</p>

<p>"Uncle!" she said, brokenly, then she stopped.</p>

<p>The clock chimed the half-hour; it was time that she started,
if she intended to obey Leycester.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>Unconsciously the old man helped her.</p>

<p>"You look pale this morning, my dear," he said, patting her
shoulder. "Go and run in the meadows and get some color on
your cheeks; I miss it."</p>

<p>Stella took up her hat, which was generally lying about ready
to be snatched up, and kissed him without a word, and left the
room.</p>

<p>Five minutes afterward she passed out into the lane and hurried
toward the road.</p>

<p>Frank was waiting for her with boyish impatience.</p>

<p>"I thought you were never coming!" he exclaimed. "We
haven't over much time," and he slung the two bags together and
led the way; but Stella paused a moment to look back with
a pang at her heart, and it was not until Frank seized her arm
that she moved toward the railway station.</p>

<p>But once there, when the tickets were taken, the excitement
buoyed her up. Frank, with the two bags, was perpetually on
the alert, watching for someone they knew, and preparing to
meet them with some excuse.</p>

<p>But no one of the village people appeared on the platform, and
much to Frank's relief, the train drew up.</p>

<p>With all the pride of a chief conspirator and guardian, he put
Stella into a carriage and was stepping in after her, when a
groom came up to the door and touched his hat.</p>

<p>"Mr. Etheridge&mdash;Mr. Frank Etheridge, sir?" he said, respectfully.</p>

<p>Frank stared, but the man seemed prepared for some little
hesitation, and without waiting for an answer, thrust a note into
Frank's hand.</p>

<p>"From Lord Guildford, sir," he said.</p>

<p>The train moved off, and Frank tore open the envelope.</p>

<p>"Why, Stella," he exclaimed, in an excited whisper, though
they were alone in the carriage, "it is from Lord Leycester.
Look here! he wants us to get out at the station before London&mdash;at
Vauxhall&mdash;he has changed his plans slightly," and he held
the note out to her.</p>

<p>Stella took it. It was written on paper bearing the Wyndward
crest; the hand-writing was exactly like that of Lord
Leycester. No suspicion of its genuineness crossed her mind
for a moment, but yet she said:</p>

<p>"But&mdash;Frank&mdash;isn't Lord Leycester in London?"</p>

<p>Frank thought a moment.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said; "but he must have sent this down to Lord
Guildford; sent it down by special messenger&mdash;special train perhaps.
It wouldn't matter to him what trouble or expense he
took. And yet how careful he is. He asks us to destroy it at
once. Tear it up, Stella, and throw it out of the window."</p>

<p>Stella read the note again, and then slowly and reluctantly
tore it into small fragments and dropped it out of the window.</p>

<p>"Of course we must stop," said Frank. "I think I know
what it is. Something had prevented him from meeting us, and
he thought you would rather get out at a nearer station than go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
through the crowd at the terminus. Isn't it thoughtful and considerate
of him?"</p>

<p>"He is always thoughtful and considerate," said Stella, in a
low voice.</p>

<p>Then Frank launched forth in a pæan of praise.</p>

<p>There was nobody like Leycester; nobody so handsome and so
brave or noble.</p>

<p>"You'll be the happiest girl in the whole world, Stel," he exclaimed,
his blue eyes alight with excitement. "Think of it.
And, Stella, you will let me see you sometimes; you will let me
come and stay with you?"</p>

<p>And Stella, with a moist look about her eyes, put her hand on
his arm and murmured:</p>

<p>"Where my home may be, there will be a sister's welcome for
you, Frank."</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid I shall be a nuisance, Stel," he said. "I
shan't bore you for long. I shall only want to come and see you
and share your happiness; and I don't think Lord Leycester will
mind."</p>

<p>And Stella smiled as she thought in her innermost heart how
sure she was of Lord Leycester not minding.</p>

<p>The train was an express one, and stopped at very few stations,
but when those stoppages occurred, Frank, in his character of
guardian, always drew the curtains and kept a watch for intruders,
notwithstanding that he had told the guard to lock the
door.</p>

<p>"You see, it isn't as if you were an ordinary looking girl," he
explained; "a man wouldn't get a glimpse of you without wanting
to take second, and it's best to be careful. I'm engaged to
watch over you, and I must do it."</p>

<p>He was so happy, so boyishly gratified at his own importance,
that Stella could not help laughing.</p>

<p>"I believe you are thoroughly enjoying the wickedness of the
thing, Frank," she said, with a little sigh that had not much of
unhappiness.</p>

<p>"No," he said; "but I want to hear Lord Leycester say,
'Thank you, Frank,' and to see him smile when he says it. Do
you think he will let me go with you, or will he send me back,
Stel?"</p>

<p>Stella shook her head.</p>

<p>"I do not know," she answered; "I feel like a person groping
in the dark. Go with us! Yes, you must go with us!" she
added. "Frank, you must go with me!"</p>

<p>"I'll stay with you till doomsday, and go to the end of the
world with you," he responded, "if he will let me!"</p>

<p>It seemed a long journey to both of them; to Frank, in his
impatience; to Stella, in the whirl of excited and conflicting
emotions. But at last they reached Vauxhall.</p>

<p>Frank got the door unlocked and gave up the tickets; then he
stepped out on to the platform, telling Stella to remain in the
carriage for a moment while he examined the ground.</p>

<p>But there was not much need for caution; as he stepped out,
a thin, strange-looking old man came up to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Etheridge!" he asked.</p>

<p>Frank replied in the affirmative.</p>

<p>The old man nodded.</p>

<p>"All right, sir; the brougham is waiting;" then he looked
round expectantly, and Frank went and got Stella out.</p>

<p>The old man just glanced at her, not curiously, but in a
mechanical sort of way, as if he were a machine, and he turned
toward the carriage and took up the bags.</p>

<p>Stella laid her hand on Frank's arm with a questioning gesture;
it was not exactly one of fear or of suspicion, but a strange,
instinctive commingling of both sensations.</p>

<p>"Ask him, Frank!" she murmured.</p>

<p>Frank nodded, understanding her in a moment, and stopped
the strange old man.</p>

<p>"Wait a moment," he said; "you come from&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The man looked round.</p>

<p>"Better not mention names here, sir," he said. "I am obeying
my orders. The brougham is waiting outside."</p>

<p>"It is all right," answered Frank; "he knows my name. He
is quite right to be careful."</p>

<p>They followed the man down the stairs; a brougham was in
waiting, as he had said, and he put the bags inside and held the
door open for them to enter.</p>

<p>Stella paused&mdash;even at that moment she paused with the same
instinctive feeling of distrust&mdash;but Frank whispered, "Be
quick," and she entered.</p>

<p>The old man closed the door.</p>

<p>"You know where to drive," said Frank, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"I know, sir," he said, in the same expressionless, apathetic
fashion, and mounted to the box.</p>

<p>Stella looked at the crowded streets through which they drove
at a rapid pace, and a strange feeling of helplessness took possession
of her. She would not own to herself that she was disappointed
at Leycester's not meeting her, but his absence filled
her with a vague alarm and disquietude, which she mentally
assured herself were foolish and unwoman-like.</p>

<p>But the vastness and strangeness of the great city overwhelmed
her.</p>

<p>"Do you know where Bruton street is?" she asked, in a low
voice.</p>

<p>"No," said Frank; "but it must be in the West-end somewhere,
of course. He must be going to Leycester's rooms. I
wonder what prevented him from meeting us."</p>

<p>Stella wondered too, little dreaming that Leycester was pacing
up and down the platform at Waterloo at that moment, and impatiently
awaiting the arrival of the train that was, he thought,
to bring his love.</p>

<p>"I expect," said Frank, "that something turned up at the
last moment&mdash;something to do with the ceremony."</p>

<p>A sudden dash of color came into Stella's face, but it went
again the next moment, and she leant back and watched the
people hurrying along the streets, with eyes that scarcely saw
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>The brougham, a well appointed one, driven by a man in plain
livery, seemed to wind about a great deal and cover a long
stretch of ground, but at last it drove under an archway and
into a quiet square, and stopped before one of a series of tall
and dingy-looking houses.</p>

<p>Frank let down the window as the old man opened the door.</p>

<p>"Is this Bruton street?" said Frank.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said the man, quietly.</p>

<p>Frank stepped out and looked around.</p>

<p>"These are lawyers' offices," he said.</p>

<p>"Quite right, sir," was the response. "The gentleman is
waiting for you."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;&mdash;" said Frank, inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Lord Leycester Wyndward," he replied.</p>

<p>Frank turned to Stella.</p>

<p>"It is all right," he said, in a low voice.</p>

<p>Stella got out and looked round. The air of quietude and
gloomy depression seemed to strike her, but she put her hand
on Frank's arm, and then followed the man into the doorway.</p>

<p>"Come as gently as you can, sir," he muttered. "It's better
the young lady shouldn't be seen."</p>

<p>Frank nodded, and they passed up the stairs. Frank threw a
glance at the numerous doors.</p>

<p>"They are lawyers' chambers," he said, in a low voice. "I
think I understand; it is something&mdash;some deed or other&mdash;Leycester
wants you to sign."</p>

<p>Stella did not speak. The chill which had fallen on her as she
alighted seemed to grow keener.</p>

<p>Suddenly the man stopped before a door, the name on which
had been covered over with a sheet of paper.</p>

<p>Could they have seen through it, and read the name of Jasper
Adelstone, there would have been time to draw back, but unsuspectingly
they followed the man in, the door closed, and unseen
by them, was locked.</p>

<p>"This way, sir," said Scrivell, and he opened the inner door
and ushered them in.</p>

<p>"If you'll take a seat for a moment, sir," he said, putting
two chairs forward, and addressing Frank, "I will tell him you
have arrived," and he went out.</p>

<p>Stella sat down, but Frank went to the window and looked
out, then he came back to her restlessly and excitedly.</p>

<p>"I wonder where he is&mdash;why he does not come?" he said,
impatiently.</p>

<p>Stella looked up; her lips were trembling.</p>

<p>"There, don't look like that!" he exclaimed, with a smile.
"It is all right!"</p>

<p>As he spoke he drew near the table aimlessly, and as aimlessly
glanced at the piles of papers with which it was strewn.</p>

<p>"I am making you nervous with my excitement&mdash;&mdash;" he stopped
suddenly, and snatched up one of the papers. It was a
folded brief, and bore upon its surface the name of Jasper Adelstone,
written in large letters.</p>

<p>He stared at it for a moment as if it had bitten him, then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
with an inarticulate cry, he flung it down and sprang toward
her.</p>

<p>"Stella, we have been trapped! Come! quick!"</p>

<p>Stella sprang to her feet, and instinctively moved to the door:
but before she had taken a couple of steps the door opened, and
Jasper Adelstone stood before them.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Jasper Adelstone</span> closed the door behind him, and stood
looking at them.</p>

<p>His face was very pale, his lips were tightly compressed, and
there was that peculiar look of decision and resolution which
Stella had often remarked.</p>

<p>True it struck her as ominous&mdash;a chill, cold and awesome, ran
through her&mdash;but she stood and confronted him with a face that,
though as pale as his own, showed no sign of fear; her eyes met
his own with a haughty, questioning gaze.</p>

<p>"Mr. Adelstone," she said, in low, clear, indignant tones,
"what does this mean?"</p>

<p>Before he could make any reply, Frank stepped between them,
and with crimson face and flashing eyes confronted him.</p>

<p>"Yes! what does this mean, Mr. Adelstone?" he echoed.
"Why have you brought us here&mdash;entrapped us?"</p>

<p>Jasper Adelstone just glanced at him, then looked at Stella&mdash;pale,
beautiful and indignant.</p>

<p>"I fear I have offended you," he said, in a low, clear voice,
his eyes fixed with concentrated watchful intentness on her
face.</p>

<p>"Offended!" echoed Stella, with mingled surprise and anger.
"There is no question of offense, Mr. Adelstone. This&mdash;this
that you have done is an insult!"</p>

<p>And her face flushed hotly.</p>

<p>He shook his head gravely, and his hands clasped themselves
behind his back, where they pecked at each other in his effort to
remain calm and self-possessed under her anger and scorn.</p>

<p>"It is not an insult; it was not intended as an insult.
Stella&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My name is Etheridge, Mr. Adelstone," Stella broke in,
calmly and proudly. "Be good enough to address me by my
title of courtesy and surname."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," he said, in slow tones. "Miss Etheridge,
I am aware that the step I have taken&mdash;and I beg you to
mark that I do not attempt to deny that it is through my order
that you are here&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We know all that!" interrupted Frank, fiercely. "We
don't wish for any verbiage from you; we only want, my cousin
and I, a direct answer to our question, 'Why have you done
this?' When you have answered it, we will leave you as quickly
as possible. If you don't choose to answer, we will leave you
without. In fact, Stella"&mdash;and he turned with a glance of contempt
and angry scorn at the tall motionless figure with the
pale face and compressed lips&mdash;"in fact, Stella, I don't think we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
much care to know. We had better go, I think, and leave it to
someone else to demand an explanation and reparation."</p>

<p>Jasper did not look at him, took no notice whatever of the
boyish scorn and indignation: he had borne Stella's; the boy's
could not touch him after hers.</p>

<p>"I am ready to afford you an explanation," he said to Stella,
with an emphasis on the 'you.'</p>

<p>Stella was silent, her eyes turned away from him, as if the
very thought of him were distasteful to her.</p>

<p>"Go on, we are waiting!" exclaimed Frank, with all a boy's
directness.</p>

<p>"I said that I would afford 'you,' Miss Etheridge," said
Jasper. "I think it would be better if you were to hear me
alone."</p>

<p>"What!" shouted Frank, drawing Stella's arm through
his.</p>

<p>"Alone," repeated Jasper. "It would be better for you&mdash;for
all of us," he repeated, with a significance in his voice that sank
to Stella's heart.</p>

<p>"I won't hear of it!" exclaimed Frank. "I am here to protect
her. I would not leave her alone with you a moment. You
are quite capable of murdering her!"</p>

<p>Then, for the first time, Jasper noticed the boy's presence.</p>

<p>"Are you afraid that I shall do you harm?" he said, with a
cold smile.</p>

<p>He knew Stella.</p>

<p>The cold sneer stung her.</p>

<p>"I am not afraid of those I despise," she said, hotly. "Go,
Frank. You will come when I call you."</p>

<p>"I shall not move," he responded, earnestly. "This man&mdash;this
Jasper Adelstone&mdash;has already shown himself capable of an
illegal, a criminal act, for it is illegal and criminal to kidnap
anyone, and he has kidnapped us. I shall not leave you. You
know," and he turned his eyes reproachfully on Stella, "I am
responsible for you."</p>

<p>Stella's face flushed, then went pale.</p>

<p>"I know," she said, in a low voice and she pressed his arm.
"But&mdash;but&mdash;I think it is better that I should listen to him. You
see"&mdash;and her voice dropped still lower and grew tremulous, so
that Jasper Adelstone could not hear it&mdash;"you see that we are
in his power; we are his prisoners almost; and he will not let us
go till I have heard him. It will be more prudent to yield.
Think, Frank, who is waiting all this time."</p>

<p>Frank started, and appeared suddenly convinced.</p>

<p>"Very well," he whispered. "Call me the moment you want
me. And, mind, if he is impertinent&mdash;he can be, you know&mdash;call
at once."</p>

<p>Then he moved to the door, but paused and looked at Jasper
with all the scorn and contempt he could summon up into his
boyish face.</p>

<p>"I am going, Mr. Adelstone; but, remember, it is only because
my cousin wishes me to. You will say what you have to say,
quickly, please; and say it respectfully, too."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>Jasper held the door for him calmly and stolidly, and Frank
passed out into the outer office. There he put on his hat and
made for the door, struck by a sudden bright idea. He would
drive to Bruton Street and fetch Lord Leycester. But as he
touched the door old Scrivell rose from his seat and shook his
head.</p>

<p>"Door's locked, sir," he said.</p>

<p>Frank turned purple.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he exclaimed. "Let me out at once;
immediately."</p>

<p>The old man shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Orders, sir; orders," he said, in his dry voice, and resumed
his work, deaf to all the boy's threats, entreaties, and bribes.</p>

<p>Jasper closed the door and crossing the room laid his hand
on a chair and signed respectfully to Stella to sit down, but
without a word she drew a little away and remained standing,
her eyes fixed on his face, her lips tightly pressed together.</p>

<p>He inclined his head and stood before her, one white hand
resting on the table, the other thrust into his vest.</p>

<p>"Miss Etheridge," he said, slowly, and with intense earnestness,
"I beg you to believe that the course which I have felt
bound to adopt has been productive of as much pain and grief
to me as it can possibly have been to you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Stella just moved her hand with scornful impatience.</p>

<p>"Your feelings are a matter of supreme indifference to me, Mr.
Adelstone," she said, icily.</p>

<p>"I regret that, I regret it with pain that amounts to anguish,"
he said, and his lips quivered. "The sentiments of&mdash;of devotion
and attachment which I entertain for you, are no secret
to you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I cannot hear this," she said, impatiently.</p>

<p>"And yet I must urge them," he said, "for I have to urge
them as an excuse for the liberty&mdash;the unpardonable liberty as
you at present deem it&mdash;which I have taken."</p>

<p>"It is unpardonable!" she echoed, with suppressed passion.
"There is no excuse&mdash;absolutely none."</p>

<p>"And yet," he said, still quietly and insistently, "if my devotion
were less ardent, my attachment less sincere and immovable,
I should have allowed you to go on your way to ruin and
disaster."</p>

<p>Stella started and looked at him indignantly.</p>

<p>He moved his hand, slightly deprecatory of her wrath.</p>

<p>"I will not conceal from you that I knew of your destination,
of your appointment."</p>

<p>"You acted the spy!" she articulated.</p>

<p>"I acted rather the guardian!" he said. "What kind of love,
how poor and inactive that would be, which could remain quiescent
while the future of its object was at stake!"</p>

<p>Stella put up her hand to silence him.</p>

<p>"I do not care&mdash;I will not listen to your fine phrases. They
do not move me, Mr. Adelstone. To your devotion and&mdash;and
attachment I am indifferent; I refuse to accept them. I await<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
your explanations. If you have none to give, I will go," and she
made a movement as if to depart.</p>

<p>"Wait, I implore, I <i>advise</i> you."</p>

<p>Stella stopped.</p>

<p>"Hear me to the end," he said. "You will not permit me
to allude to the passionate love which is my excuse and my warranty
for what I have done. So be it. I will speak of it no
more, if I can so control myself as to refrain from doing so. I
will speak of yourself and&mdash;and of the man who plots your
ruin."</p>

<p>Stella opened her lips, but refrained from speech, and merely
smiled a smile of pitiless scorn.</p>

<p>"I speak of Lord Leycester Wyndward," said Jasper Adelstone,
the name leaving his lips as if every word tortured them.
"It is true, is it not, that this Lord Leycester has asked you to
meet him at a place in London&mdash;at Bruton Street, his lodgings?
It is true that he has told you that he was prepared to make you
his wife!"</p>

<p>"And you will say that it is a lie, and ask me to believe you&mdash;<i>you</i>
against <i>him</i>!" she broke in, with a laugh that cut him like a
whip.</p>

<p>"No," he said; "I will admit that it may be true&mdash;I think
that it is possible that it may be true; and yet, you see, I have
braved your wrath and, far worse, your scorn, and balked
him."</p>

<p>"For a time," she said, almost beneath her breath&mdash;"for a
time, a short time. I fear, Mr. Adelstone, that he will demand
reparation, heavy reparation at your hands for such 'balking.'"</p>

<p>To save her life she could not have suppressed her threat.</p>

<p>"I do not fear Lord Leycester, or any man," he said. "Where
you are concerned I fear only&mdash;yourself."</p>

<p>"Do you intend giving me the explanation, sir?" she demanded,
impetuously.</p>

<p>"I have stepped in between him and his prey," he went on,
still gravely, "because I thought, I hoped, that were time given
you, though it were at the last moment, that you would see the
danger which lay before you, and draw back."</p>

<p>"Thanks!" she said, scornfully&mdash;"that is your explanation.
Having afforded it, be kind enough to open that door and let me
depart."</p>

<p>"Stay!" he said, and for the first time his voice broke and
showed signs of the storm that was raging within him. "Stay,
Stella&mdash;I implore, I beseech of you! Think, consider for one
moment to what doom your feet are carrying you! The man
proposes&mdash;has the audacity to propose&mdash;a clandestine elopement,
a secret marriage; he treats you as if you were not worthy to be
his wife, as if you were the dirt under his feet! Do you think,
dare you, blinded as you are by a momentary passion, dare you
hope that any good can spring from such an union, that any
happiness can follow such a shameful marriage? Dare you hope
that this man's love&mdash;love!&mdash;which will not brave the temporary
anger and contempt of his relations, can be strong enough to
last a lifetime? Think, Stella! He is ashamed of you already;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
he, the heir to Wyndward, is ashamed to make you his bride
before the world. He must lower and degrade you by a secret
ceremony. What is his love compared with mine&mdash;with mine?"
and in the fierce emotion of the moment he put his hand upon
her arm and held her.</p>

<p>With a fierce, angry scorn, which no one who knew Stella
Etheridge could have thought her capable of, she flung his hand
from her and confronted him, her beautiful face looking lovely
in its scorn and wrath.</p>

<p>"Silence!" she exclaimed, her breast heaving, her eyes darting
lightning. "You&mdash;you coward! You dare to speak thus
to me, a weak, defenseless girl, whom you have entrapped into
listening to you! I dare you to utter them to him&mdash;him, the
man you traduce and slander. You speak of love; you know
not what it is! You speak of shame&mdash;&mdash;" she paused, the word
seemed to overcome her. "Shame," she repeated, struggling
for breath and composure; "you do not know what that is.
Shall I tell you? I have never felt it until now; I feel it now,
because I have been weak enough to remain and listen to you!
It is shameful that your hand should have touched me! It is
shameful that I should have listened to your protestations of
love&mdash;love! You speak of the shame which he would bring
upon me! Well, then&mdash;listen for once and all!&mdash;if such shame
were to befall me from his hand, I would go to meet it, yes, and
welcome it, rather than take from yours all the honor which
you could extend to me! You say that I am going to ruin and
unhappiness! So be it; I accept your words&mdash;to silence you,
learn from my own lips that I would rather bear such shame
and misery with him, than happiness and honor with you.
Have I&mdash;have I," she panted, "spoken plainly enough?" and
she looked down at him with passionate scorn. He was white,
white as death, his hands hung at his side clinched and burning;
his tongue seemed to cleave to the roof of his mouth, and
render speech impossible.</p>

<p>Her scorn lashed him; every word fell like the thong of a
knout, and cut into his heart; and all the while his eyes rested
on hers with anguished entreaty.</p>

<p>"Spare me," he cried, hoarsely, at last. "Spare me! I have
tried to spare you!"</p>

<p>"You&mdash;spare me!" she retorted, with a short contemptuous
laugh.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, wetting his lips, "I have tried to spare you!
I tried argument, entreaty, all to no purpose! Now&mdash;now you
compel me to use force!"</p>

<p>She glanced at the door, though she seemed to know instinctively
that he did not mean physical force.</p>

<p>"I would have saved you without this last step," he said,
slowly, almost inaudibly. "I call upon you to remember this in
the after-time. That not until you had repulsed all my efforts
to turn you from your purpose&mdash;not until you had lashed me
with your scorn and contempt, did I take up this last weapon.
If in using it&mdash;though I use it as mercifully as I can&mdash;it turns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
and wounds you, bear this in mind, that not until the last did I
direct it against you!"</p>

<p>Stella put her hand to her lips; they were trembling with excitement.</p>

<p>"I will not hear another word," she said. "I care as little for
your threat&mdash;this is a threat&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is a threat," he said, with deadly calmness.</p>

<p>"As I do for your entreaties. You cannot harm me."</p>

<p>"No," he said; "but I can harm those you love."</p>

<p>She smiled, and moved to the door.</p>

<p>"Stay," he said. "For their sakes, remain and hear me to
the end."</p>

<p>She paused.</p>

<p>"You speak of shame," he said, "and fear it as naught. You
do not know what it means, and&mdash;and&mdash;I forget the fearful
words that stained your lips. But there are others, those you
love, for whom shame means death&mdash;worse than death."</p>

<p>She looked at him with a smile of contemptuous disbelief. She
did not believe one word of the vague threat, not one word.</p>

<p>"Believe me," he said, "there hangs above the heads of those
you love a shame as deadly and awful as that sword which hung
above the head of Damocles. It hangs by a single thread which
I, and I alone, can sever. Say but the word and I can cast aside
that shame. Turn from me to him&mdash;to him&mdash;and I cut the
thread and the sword falls!"</p>

<p>Stella laughed scornfully.</p>

<p>"You have mistaken your vocation," she said. "You were
intended for the stage, Mr. Adelstone. I regret that I have no
further time to waste upon your efforts. Permit me to go."</p>

<p>"Go, then," he said, "and the misery of those dear to you be
upon your hands, for you will have dealt it, not I! Go! But
mark me, before you have reached the man who has ensnared
you that shame will have fallen; a shame so bitter that it will
yawn like a gulf between you and him; a gulf which no time
can ever bridge over."</p>

<p>"It&mdash;it is a lie!" she breathed, her eyes fixed upon his white
face, but she paused and did not go.</p>

<p>He inclined his head.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "it is true, an awful, shameful truth. You will
wait and listen?"</p>

<p>She looked at him for a moment in silence.</p>

<p>"I will wait five minutes&mdash;just five minutes," she said, and
she pointed to the clock. "And I warn you&mdash;it is I who warn
you now&mdash;that by no word will I attempt to screen you from the
punishment which will meet this lie."</p>

<p>"I am content," he said, and there was something in the cold
tone of assured triumph that struck to her heart.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">"Five</span> minutes!" said Stella, warningly; and she turned her
face from him, and kept her eyes fixed on the clock.</p>

<p>"It will suffice," said Jasper. "I have to ask you to bear with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
me while I tell you a short history. I will mention no names&mdash;you
yourself will be able to supply them. All I have to ask of
you further is that you will hear me to the end. The history is
of father and son."</p>

<p>Stella did not move; she thought that he referred to the earl
and Leycester. She had determined to listen calmly until the
five minutes were expired, and then to go&mdash;to go without a
word.</p>

<p>"The father was an eminent painter"&mdash;Stella started slightly,
but kept her eyes fixed on the clock&mdash;"a man who was highly
gifted, of a rare and noble mind, and possessed of undeniable
genius. Even as a young man his gifts were meeting with acknowledgment.
He married a woman above him in station,
beautiful, and fashionable, but altogether unworthy of him. As
might have been expected, the marriage turned out ill. The
wife, having nothing in common with her high-souled husband,
plunged into the world, and was swallowed up in its vortex. I
do not wish to speak of her further; she brought him shame."</p>

<p>Stella paled to the lips.</p>

<p>"Shame so deep that he cast aside his ambition and left the
world. Casting away his old life, and separating himself entirely
from it&mdash;separating himself from the child which the woman
who had betrayed him had born to him&mdash;he settled in a remote
country village, forgotten and effaced. The son was brought up
by guardians appointed by the father, who could never bring himself
to see him. This boy went to school, to college, was launched,
so to speak, on the world without a father's care. The evil results
which usually follow such a starting followed here. The boy, left
to himself, or at best to the hired guardianship of a tutor,
plunged into life. He was a handsome, high-spirited boy, and
found, as is usual, ready companionship. Folly&mdash;I will not say
vice&mdash;worked its usual charm; the boy, alone and uncared for,
was led astray. In an unthinking moment he committed a
crime&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Stella, white and breathless, turned upon him.</p>

<p>"It is false!" she breathed.</p>

<p>He looked at her steadily.</p>

<p>"Committed a crime. It was done unthinkingly, on the spur
of the moment; but it was done irrevocably. The punishment
for the crime was a heavy one&mdash;he was doomed to spend the
best part of his life as a convict&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Stella moaned and put up her hand to her eyes.</p>

<p>"It is not true."</p>

<p>"Doomed to a felon's expiation. Think of it. A handsome,
high-born, high-spirited, perhaps gifted lad, doomed to a felon's,
a convict's fate! Can you not picture him, working in chains,
clad in yellow, branded with shame&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Stella leaned against the door, and hid her face.</p>

<p>"It is false&mdash;false!" she moaned; but she felt that it was
true.</p>

<p>"From that doom&mdash;one&mdash;one whom you have lashed with
your scorn&mdash;stepped forward to save him."</p>

<p>"You?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>"I," he said&mdash;"even I!"</p>

<p>She turned to him slightly.</p>

<p>"You did this?"</p>

<p>He inclined his head.</p>

<p>"I did it," he repeated. "But for me he would be, at this
moment, working out his sentence, the just sentence of the outraged
law."</p>

<p>Stella was silent, regarding him with eyes distended with
horror.</p>

<p>"And he&mdash;he knew it?" she murmured, brokenly.</p>

<p>"No," he said. "He did not know it; he does not know it
even now."</p>

<p>Stella breathed a sigh, then shuddered as she remembered
how the boy Frank had insulted and scorned this silent, inflexible
man, who had saved him from a felon's fate.</p>

<p>"He did not know it!" she said. "Forgive him!"</p>

<p>He smiled a strange smile.</p>

<p>"The lad is nothing to me," he said. "I have nothing to forgive.
One does not feel angered at the attack of a gnat; one
brushes the insect off, or lets it remain as the case may be. This
lad is nothing to me. So far as he is concerned I might have
allowed him to take his punishment. I saved him, not for his
sake, but for another's."</p>

<p>Stella leaned against the door. She was beginning to feel the
meshes of the net that was drawing closer and closer around
her.</p>

<p>"For another," he continued, "I saved him for your sake."</p>

<p>She moistened her parched lips and raised her eyes.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I am very grateful," she murmured.</p>

<p>His face flushed slightly.</p>

<p>"I did not seek your gratitude; I did not desire that you
should even know that I had done this thing. Neither he nor
you would ever have known it, but&mdash;but for this that has happened.
It would have gone down with me into my grave&mdash;a
secret. It would have done so, although you had refused me
your love, although you should have given your heart to another.
If"&mdash;and he paused&mdash;"if that other had been a man worthy of
you." Stella's face flushed, and her eyes flashed, but she remembered
all that he had done, and averted her gaze from him.
"If that other had been one likely to have insured your happiness,
I would have gone my way and remained silent; but it is
not so. This man, this Lord Leycester, is one who will effect
your ruin, one from whom I must&mdash;I will&mdash;save you. It is he
who rendered this disclosure necessary."</p>

<p>He was silent, and Stella stood, her eyes bent on the ground.
Even yet she did not realize the power he held over her&mdash;over
those she loved.</p>

<p>"I am very grateful," she said at last. "I am fully sensible
of all that you have done for us, and I am sorry that&mdash;that I
should have spoken as I did, though"&mdash;and she raised her eyes
with a sudden frank wistfulness&mdash;"I was much provoked."</p>

<p>"What was I to do?" he asked. She shook her head. "Could
I stand idle and see you drift to destruction?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>"I shall not go to destruction," she said, with a troubled look.
"You do not know Lord Leycester&mdash;you do not know&mdash;but we
will not speak of that," she broke off, suddenly. "I will go
now, please. I am very grateful, and&mdash;and&mdash;I hope you will
forgive all that has passed!"</p>

<p>He looked at her.</p>

<p>"I will forgive all&mdash;<i>all</i>," he emphasized, "if you will turn
back; if you will go back to your home, and promise that
this thing which he has asked you to do shall not come to
pass."</p>

<p>She turned upon him.</p>

<p>"You have no right&mdash;&mdash;" then she stopped, smitten with a
sudden fear by the expression of his face. "I cannot do that,"
she said, in a constrained voice.</p>

<p>He closed his hands tightly together.</p>

<p>"Do not force me," he said. "You will not force me to compel
you?"</p>

<p>She looked at him tremblingly.</p>

<p>"Force!"</p>

<p>"Yes, force! You speak of gratitude; but I do not rely on
that. If you were really grateful to me you would go back; but
you are not. I cannot trust to gratitude." Then he came closer
to her, and his voice dropped.</p>

<p>"Stella, I have sworn that this shall not be&mdash;that he shall not
have you! I cannot break my oath. Do you not understand?"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"No! I know that you cannot prevent me."</p>

<p>"I can," he said. "You do not understand. I saved the boy,
but I can destroy him."</p>

<p>She shrank back.</p>

<p>"With a word!" he said, almost fiercely, his lips trembling.
"One word, and he is destroyed. You doubt? See!" And he
drew a paper from his pocket-book. "The crime he committed
was forgery&mdash;forgery! Here is the proof!"</p>

<p>She shrank back still further, and held up her hands as if to
shut the paper from her sight.</p>

<p>"Do not deceive yourself," he said, in his intense voice; "his
safety lies in my hands&mdash;I hold the sword. It is for you to say
whether I shall let it fall."</p>

<p>"Spare him!" she breathed, panting&mdash;"spare me!"</p>

<p>"I will spare him&mdash;I will save both him and you. Stella, say
but the word; say to me here, now, 'Jasper, I will marry you,'
and he is safe!"</p>

<p>With a low cry she sank against the door, and looked at him.</p>

<p>"I will not!" she panted, like some wild animal driven to bay.</p>

<p>"I will not."</p>

<p>His face darkened.</p>

<p>"You hate me so much?"</p>

<p>She was silent, regarding him with the same fearful, hunted
look.</p>

<p>"You hate me!" he said, between his teeth. "But even that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
shall not prevent me from having my way. You will learn to
hate me less&mdash;in time to love me."</p>

<p>She shuddered, and he saw the shudder, and it seemed to lash
him into madness.</p>

<p>"I say you shall! Such love as mine cannot exist in vain,
cannot be repelled; it must, it must win love in return. I will
chance it. When you are my wife&mdash;do not shrink, mine you
must and shall be!&mdash;you will grow to a knowledge of the
strength of my devotion, and admit that I was justified&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, never!" she panted.</p>

<p>He drew back, and let his hand fall on the back of the chair.</p>

<p>"Is that answer final?" he said hoarsely.</p>

<p>"Never!" she reiterated.</p>

<p>"Remember!" he said. "In that word you pronounce the
doom of this lad; by that word you let fall the sword, you
darken the few remaining years of an old man's life with
shame!"</p>

<p>White and breathless she sank on to the floor and so knelt&mdash;absolutely
knelt&mdash;to him, with outstretched hands and imploring
eyes.</p>

<p>He looked at her, his heart beating, his lips quivering, and his
hand moved toward the bell.</p>

<p>"If I ring this it is to send for a constable. If I ring this, it
is to give this lad into custody on a charge of forgery. It is impossible
for him to escape, the evidence is complete and damning."</p>

<p>His hand touched the bell, had almost pressed it, when Stella
uttered a word.</p>

<p>"Stay!" she said, and so hoarse, so unnatural was the sound
of her voice, that it went to his heart like a stab.</p>

<p>Slowly, with the movement of a person numbed and almost
unconscious, she rose and came toward him.</p>

<p>Her face was white, white to the lip, her eyes fixed not on
him, but beyond him; she had every appearance of one moving
in a dream.</p>

<p>"Stay?" she said. "Do not ring."</p>

<p>His hand fell from the bell, and he stood regarding her with
eager, watchful eyes.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you consent?" he asked hoarsely.</p>

<p>Without moving her eyes, she seemed to look at him.</p>

<p>"Tell me," she said, in slow, mechanical tones, "tell me all&mdash;all
that you wish me to do, all that I must do to save them."</p>

<p>Her agony touched him, but he remained inflexible, immovable.</p>

<p>"It is soon told," he said. "Say to me, 'Jasper, I will be
your wife!' and I am content. In return, I promise that on the
day, the hour in which you become my wife, I will give you
this paper; upon it the boy's fate depends. Once this is destroyed
he is safe&mdash;absolutely."</p>

<p>She held out her hand mechanically.</p>

<p>"Let me look at it."</p>

<p>He glanced at her, scarcely suspiciously but hesitatingly, for a
moment, then placed the paper in her hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>She took it, shuddering faintly.</p>

<p>"Show me!"</p>

<p>He put his finger on the forged name. Stella's eyes dwelt
upon it with horror for a moment, then she held out the paper
to him.</p>

<p>"He&mdash;he wrote that?"</p>

<p>"He wrote it," he answered. "It is sufficient to send
him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She put up her hand to stop him.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;and to earn the paper I must&mdash;marry you?"</p>

<p>He was silent, but he made a gesture of assent.</p>

<p>She turned her head away for a moment, then she looked him
full in the eyes, a strange, awful look.</p>

<p>"I will do it," she said, every word falling like ice from her
white lips.</p>

<p>A crimson flush stained his face.</p>

<p>"Stella! My Stella!" he cried.</p>

<p>She put up her hand; she did not shrink back, but simply put
up her hand, and it was he who shrank.</p>

<p>"Do not touch me," she said, calmly, "or&mdash;or I will not
answer for myself."</p>

<p>He wiped the cold beads from his brow.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I am content!" he said. "I have your promise. I know
you too well to dream that you would break it. I am content.
In time&mdash;well, I will say no more."</p>

<p>Then he went to the table and pressed the bell.</p>

<p>She looked up at him with a dull, numbed expression of inquiry
which he understood and answered.</p>

<p>"You will see. I have thought of everything. I foresaw
that you would yield and have planned everything."</p>

<p>The door opened as he spoke, and Scrivell came in followed
by Frank, who hurled Scrivell out of the way and sprang before
Jasper, inarticulate with rage.</p>

<p>But before he could find breath for words, his eyes fell upon
Stella's face, and a change came over him.</p>

<p>"What does this mean?" he stammered. "What do you
mean, Mr. Adelstone, by this outrage? Do you know that I
have been kept a prisoner&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jasper interrupted him calmly, quietly, with an exasperating
smile.</p>

<p>"You are a prisoner no longer, my dear Frank!"</p>

<p>"How dare you!" exclaimed the enraged boy, and he raised
his cane.</p>

<p>It would have fallen across Jasper's face, for he made no attempt
to ward it, but Stella sprang between them, and it fell on
her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Frank," she moaned rather than cried, "you&mdash;you must
not."</p>

<p>"Stella," he exclaimed, "stand away from him. I think I
shall kill him."</p>

<p>She laid her hand upon his arm and looked up into his face
with, ah! what an anguish of sorrowful pity and love.</p>

<p>"Frank," she breathed, pressing her hand to her bosom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
"listen to me. He&mdash;Mr. Adelstone was&mdash;was right. He has
done all for&mdash;for the best. You&mdash;you will beg his pardon."</p>

<p>He stared at her as if he thought that she had taken leave of
her senses.</p>

<p>"What! What do you say!" he cried, below his breath.
"Are you mad, Stella?"</p>

<p>She put her hand to her brow with a strange, weird smile.</p>

<p>"I wish&mdash;I almost think I am. No, Frank, not another word.
You must not ask why. I cannot tell you. Only this, that&mdash;that
Mr. Adelstone has explained, and that&mdash;that"&mdash;her voice
faltered&mdash;"we must go back."</p>

<p>"Go back? Not go to Leycester?" he demanded, incredulous
and astonished. "Do you know what you are saying?"</p>

<p>She smiled, a smile more bitter than tears.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. Bear with me, Frank."</p>

<p>"Bear with you? What does she mean? Do you mean to
say that you have allowed yourself to be persuaded by this&mdash;this
hound&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Frank! Frank!"</p>

<p>"Do not stop him," came the quiet, overstrained voice of
'the hound.'</p>

<p>"This hound, I said," repeated the boy, bitterly. "Has he
persuaded you to break faith with Leycester? It is impossible.
You would not, <i>could</i> not, be so&mdash;so bad."</p>

<p>Stella looked at him, and the tears sprang to her eyes.</p>

<p>"Have pity, and&mdash;and&mdash;send him away," she said, without
turning to Jasper.</p>

<p>He went up to Frank, who drew back as he approached, as if
he were something loathsome.</p>

<p>"You are making your cousin unhappy by this conduct," he
said. "It is as she says. She has changed her mind."</p>

<p>"It is a lie," retorted Frank, fiercely. "You have frightened
her and tortured her into this. But you shall not succeed. It is
easy for you to frighten a woman, as easily as it is to entrap her;
but you will sing a different tune before a man. Stella, come
with me. You must, you <i>shall</i> come. We will go to Lord Leycester."</p>

<p>"It is unnecessary," cried Jasper, quietly. "His lordship will
be here in a few minutes."</p>

<p>Stella started.</p>

<p>"No, no," she said, and moved to the door. Frank, staring at
Jasper, caught and held her.</p>

<p>"Is that a lie, too?" he demanded. "If not&mdash;if it be true&mdash;then
we will wait. We shall see how much longer you will be
able to crow, Mr. Adelstone!"</p>

<p>"Let us go, Frank," implored Stella. "You will let me
go now?" And she turned to Jasper.</p>

<p>Frank was almost driven to madness by her tone.</p>

<p>"What has he said and done to change you like this?" he said.
"You speak to him as if you were his slave!"</p>

<p>She looked at him sadly.</p>

<p>Jasper shook his head.</p>

<p>"Wait," he said&mdash;"it will be better that you wait. Trust me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
I will spare you as much as possible; but it will be better that he
should learn all that he has to learn from your lips, here and
now."</p>

<p>She bowed her head, and still holding Frank's arm sank into a
chair.</p>

<p>The boy was about to burst out again, but she stopped him.</p>

<p>"Hush!" she said, "do not speak, every word cuts me to the
heart. Not a word, dear&mdash;not another word. Let us wait."</p>

<p>They had not long to wait.</p>

<p>There was a sound of footsteps, hurried and noisy, on the stairs&mdash;an
impatient, resolute voice uttering a question&mdash;then the door
was thrown open, and Lord Leycester burst in!</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Leycester</span> looked round for a moment eagerly, then, utterly
disregarding Jasper, he hurried across to Stella, who at his entrance
had made an involuntary movement towards him, but
had then recoiled, and stood with white face and tightly-clasped
hands.</p>

<p>"Stella!" he exclaimed, "why are you here? Why did you
not come to Waterloo? Why did you send for me?"</p>

<p>She put her hand in his, and looked him in the face&mdash;a look so
full of anguish and sorrow that he stared at her in amazement.</p>

<p>"It was I who sent for you, my lord," said Jasper, coldly.</p>

<p>Leycester just glanced at him, then returned to the study of
Stella's face.</p>

<p>"Why are you here, Stella?"</p>

<p>She did not speak, but drew her hand away and glanced at
Jasper.</p>

<p>That glance would have melted a heart of stone, but his was
one of fire and consumed all pity.</p>

<p>"Will you not speak? Great Heaven, what is the matter with
you?" demanded Leycester.</p>

<p>Jasper made a step nearer.</p>

<p>Leycester turned upon him, not fiercely, but with contempt
and amazement, then turned again to Stella.</p>

<p>"Has anything happened at home&mdash;to your uncle?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Etheridge is well," said Jasper.</p>

<p>Then Leycester turned and looked at him.</p>

<p>"Why does this man answer for you?" he said. "I did not
put any question to you, sir."</p>

<p>"I am aware of that, my lord," said Jasper, his small eyes
glittering with hate and malice, and smoldering fury. The
sight of the handsome face, the knowledge that Stella loved this
man and hated him, Jasper, maddened and tortured him, even
in his hour of triumph. "I am aware of that, Lord Leycester;
but as your questions evidently distress and embarrass Miss
Etheridge, I take upon myself to answer for her."</p>

<p>Leycester smiled as if at some strange conceit.</p>

<p>"You do indeed take upon yourself," he retorted, with great
scorn. "Perhaps you will kindly remain silent."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>Jasper's face whitened and winced.</p>

<p>"You are in my apartment, Lord Leycester."</p>

<p>"I regret to admit it. I more deeply regret that this lady
should be here. I await her explanation."</p>

<p>"And what if I say she will not gratify your curiosity?" said
Jasper, with a malignant smile.</p>

<p>"What will happen, do you mean?" asked Leycester, curtly.
"Well, I shall probably throw you out of the window."</p>

<p>Stella uttered a low cry and laid her hand upon his arm; she
knew him so well, and had no difficulty in reading the sudden
lightning in the dark eyes, and the resolute tightening of the
lips. She knew that it was no idle threat, and that a word more
from Jasper of the same kind would rouse the fierce, impetuous
anger for which Leycester was notorious.</p>

<p>In a moment his anger disappeared.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," he murmured, with a loving glance,
"I was forgetting myself. I will remember that you are here."</p>

<p>"Now, sir," and he turned to Jasper, "you appear anxious to
offer some explanation. Be as brief and as quick as you can,
please," he added curtly.</p>

<p>Jasper winced at the tone of command.</p>

<p>"I wished to spare Miss Etheridge," he said. "I have only
one desire, and that is to insure her comfort and happiness."</p>

<p>"You are very good," said Leycester, with contemptuous impatience.
"But if that is all you have to say we will rid you of
our presence, which cannot be welcome. I would rather hear
an account of these extraordinary proceedings from this lady's
lips, at first, at any rate; afterwards I may trouble you," and
his eyes darkened ominously.</p>

<p>Then he went up to Stella, and his voice dropped to a low
whisper.</p>

<p>"Come, Stella. You shall tell me what this all means," and
he offered her his arm.</p>

<p>But Stella shrank back, with a piteous look in her eyes.</p>

<p>"I cannot go with you," she murmured, as if each word cost
her an effort. "Do not ask me!"</p>

<p>"Cannot!" he said, still in the same low voice. "Stella!
Why not?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I cannot tell you! Do not ask me!" was her prayer.
"Go now&mdash;go and leave me!"</p>

<p>Lord Leycester looked from her to Frank, who shook his head
and glared at Jasper.</p>

<p>"I don't understand it, Lord Leycester; it is no use looking
to me. I have done as you asked me&mdash;at least as far as I was
able until I was prevented. We got out at Vauxhall as you
wished us to do&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I!" said Leycester, not loudly, but with an intense emphasis.
"I! I did not ask you to do anything of the kind! I have
been waiting for you at Waterloo, and thinking that I had
missed you and that you had gone on to&mdash;to the place I asked
you to go to, I hurried there. A man&mdash;Mr. Adelstone's servant,
I presume&mdash;was waiting, and told me Stella was here waiting
for me. I came here&mdash;that is all!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>Frank glared at Jasper and raised an accusing finger, which
he pointed threateningly.</p>

<p>"Ask <i>him</i> for an explanation!" he said.</p>

<p>Leicester looked at the white, defiant face.</p>

<p>"What jugglery is this, sir?" he demanded. "Am I to surmise
that&mdash;that this lady was entrapped and brought here
against her will?"</p>

<p>Jasper inclined his head.</p>

<p>"You are at liberty to surmise what you will," he said. "If
you ask me if it was through my instrumentality that this lady
was led to break the assignation you had arranged for her, I
answer that it was!"</p>

<p>"Soh!"</p>

<p>It was all Leycester said, but it spoke volumes.</p>

<p>"That I used some strategy to effect my purpose, I don't for a
moment deny. I used strategy, because it was necessary to defeat
your scheme."</p>

<p>He paused. Leycester stood upright watching him.</p>

<p>"Go on," he said, in a hard, metallic voice.</p>

<p>"I brought her here that I, her uncle's and guardian's friend,
might point out to her the danger which lay in the path on
which you would entice her. I have made it clear to her that it
is impossible she should do as you wish."</p>

<p>He paused again, and Leycester removed his eyes from the
pale face and looked at Stella.</p>

<p>"Is what this man says true?" he asked, in a low voice. "Has
he persuaded you to break faith with me?"</p>

<p>Stella looked at him, and her hands closed over each other.</p>

<p>"Don't ask her," broke in Frank. "She is not in a fit state to
answer. This fellow, this Jasper Adelstone, has bewitched her!
I think he has frightened her out of her senses by some
threat&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Frank! Hush! Oh, hush!" broke from Stella.</p>

<p>Lord Leycester started and eyed her scrutinizingly, but he
saw only anguish and pity and sorrow&mdash;not guilt&mdash;in her face.</p>

<p>"It is true," declared Frank. "This is what she has said, and
this only since I came back into the room, and I can't get any
more out of her. I think, Lord Leycester, you had better throw
him out of the window."</p>

<p>Leycester looked from one to the other. There was evidently
more in the case than could be met by following Frank's advice.</p>

<p>He put his hand to his head for a moment.</p>

<p>"I don't understand," he said, almost to himself.</p>

<p>"It is not difficult to understand," said Jasper, with an ill-concealed
sneer. "The lady absolutely refuses to keep the appointment
you made&mdash;you forced upon her. She declines to accompany
you. She&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Silence," said Leycester, in a low voice that was more terrible
than shouting. Then he turned to Stella.</p>

<p>"Is it so?" he asked.</p>

<p>She raised her eyes, and her lips moved.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said.</p>

<p>He looked as if he could not believe the evidence of his senses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
The perspiration broke out on his forehead, and his lips trembled,
but he made an effort to control himself, and succeeded.</p>

<p>"Is what this man says true, Stella?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I cannot go with you," she trembled, with downcast
eyes.</p>

<p>Leycester looked round the room as if he suspected he must be
dreaming.</p>

<p>"What does it mean?" he murmured. "Stella;" and now he
addressed her as if he were oblivious of the presence of others.
"Stella, I implore, I command you to tell me. Consider what
my position is. I&mdash;who have been expecting you as&mdash;as you
know well&mdash;find you here, and here you, with your own lips,
tell me that all is altered between us; so suddenly, so unreasonably."</p>

<p>"It must be so," she breathed. "If you would only go and
leave me!"</p>

<p>He put his hand on the back of a chair to steady himself, and
the chair shook.</p>

<p>Jasper stood gloating over his emotion.</p>

<p>"Great Heaven!" he exclaimed, "can I believe my ears? Is
this you, Stella&mdash;speaking to me in these words and in this fashion?
Why!&mdash;why!&mdash;why!"</p>

<p>And the questions burst forth from him passionately.</p>

<p>She clasped her hands, and looked up at him.</p>

<p>"Do not ask me&mdash;I cannot tell. Spare me!"</p>

<p>Leycester turned to Frank.</p>

<p>"Will you&mdash;will you leave us, my dear Frank?" he said,
hoarsely.</p>

<p>Frank went out slowly, then Leycester turned to Jasper.</p>

<p>"Hear me," he said. "You have given me to understand
that the key of this enigma is in your possession; you will be
good enough to furnish me with it. There must be no more
mystery. Understand once for all, and at once, that I will have
no trifling."</p>

<p>"Leycester!"</p>

<p>He put up his hand to her, gently, reassuringly,</p>

<p>"Do not fear; this gentleman has no need to tremble. This
matter lies between us three&mdash;at present, rather, it lies between
you two. I want to be placed on an equality, that is all." And
he smiled a fiercely-bitter smile. "Now, sir!"</p>

<p>Jasper bit his lips.</p>

<p>"I have few words to add to what I have already said. I will
say them, and I leave it to Miss Etheridge to corroborate them.
You wish to know the reason why she did not meet you as you
expected, and why she is here instead, and under my protection?"</p>

<p>Leycester moved his hand impatiently.</p>

<p>"The question is easily answered. It is because she is my
affianced wife!" said Jasper quietly.</p>

<p>Leycester looked at him steadily, but did not show by a sign
that he had been smitten as his adversary had hoped to smite
him. Instead, he seemed to recover coolness.</p>

<p>"I have been told," he said, quietly and incisively, "that you
are a clever man, Mr. Adelstone. I did not doubt it until this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
moment. I feel that you must be a fool to hope that I should
accept that statement."</p>

<p>Jasper's face grew red under the bitter scorn; he raised his
hand and pointed tremblingly to Stella.</p>

<p>"Ask her," he said, hoarsely.</p>

<p>Leycester turned to her with a start.</p>

<p>"For form's sake," he said, almost apologetically, "I will ask
you, Stella. Is this true?"</p>

<p>She raised her eyes.</p>

<p>"It is true," she breathed.</p>

<p>Leycester turned white for the first time, and seemed unable
to withdraw his eyes from hers for a moment, then he walked
up to her and took her hands.</p>

<p>"Look at me!" he said, in a low, constrained voice. "Do you
know that I am here?&mdash;I&mdash;am&mdash;here!&mdash;that I came here to protect
you? That whatever this man has said to force this mad avowal
from your lips I will make him answer for! Stella! Stella! If
you do not wish to drive me mad, look at me and tell me that
this is a lie!"</p>

<p>She looked at him sadly, sorrowfully.</p>

<p>"It is true&mdash;true," she said.</p>

<p>"Of your own free will?&mdash;you hesitate! Ah!"</p>

<p>She flung her hands before her eyes for a moment to gain
strength to deal him the blow, then with white constrained
face she said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Of my own free will!"</p>

<p>He dropped her hands, but stood looking at her.</p>

<p>Jasper's voice aroused him from the stupor which fell upon him.</p>

<p>"Come, my lord," he said, in a dry, cold voice, "you have
received your answer. Let me suggest that you have inflicted
more than enough pain upon this lady, and let me remind you
that as I am her affianced husband I have the right to request
you to leave her in peace."</p>

<p>Leycester turned to him slowly, but without speaking to him
went up to Stella.</p>

<p>"Stella," he said, and his voice was harsh and hoarse. "For
the last time I ask you&mdash;for the last time!&mdash;is this true? Have
you betrayed me for this man? Have you promised to be&mdash;his
wife?"</p>

<p>The answer came in a low clear voice:</p>

<p>"It is true. I shall be his wife."</p>

<p>He staggered slightly, but recovered himself, and stood upright,
his hands clasped, the veins on his forehead swelling.</p>

<p>"It is enough," he said. "You tell me that it is of your own
free will. I do not believe that. I know that this man has
some hold upon you. What it is I cannot guess. I feel that
you will not tell me, and that he would only lie if I asked him.
But it is enough for me. Stella&mdash;I call you so for the last time&mdash;you
have deceived me; you have kept this thing hidden from
me. May Heaven forgive you, I cannot!"</p>

<p>Then he took his hat and turned to leave the room.</p>

<p>As he did so she swayed toward him, and almost fell at his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
feet, but Jasper glided toward her and held her, and, as Leycester
turned, he saw her leaning on Jasper, her arm linked in his.</p>

<p>Without a word Leycester opened the door and went out.</p>

<p>Frank sprang toward him, but Leycester put him back with a
firm grasp.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord Leycester!" he cried.</p>

<p>Leycester paused for a moment, his hand on the boy's arm.</p>

<p>"Go to her," he said. "She has lied to me. There is something
between her and that man. I have seen her for the last
time," and before the boy could find a word of expostulation or
entreaty, Leycester pushed him aside and went out.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Leycester</span> went down the stairs with the uncertain gait of a
drunken man, and having reached the open air stood for a moment
staring round him as if he were bereft of his senses; as indeed
he almost was.</p>

<p>The shock had come so suddenly that it had deprived him of
the power of reasoning, of following the thing out to its logical
conclusion. As he walked on, threading his way along the
crowded thoroughfare, and exciting no little attention and remark
by his wild, distraught appearance, he realized that he had
lost Stella.</p>

<p>He realized that he had lost the beautiful girl who had stolen
into his heart and absorbed his love. And the manner of his
losing her made the loss so bitter! That a man, that such a
creature as this Jasper Adelstone, should come between them was
terrible. If it had been any other, who was in some fashion his
own equal&mdash;Charlie Guildford, for instance, a gentleman and a
nobleman&mdash;it would have been bad enough, but he could have
understood it. He would have felt that he had been fairly beaten;
but Jasper Adelstone!</p>

<p>Then it was so evident that love was not altogether the reason
of her treachery and desertion; there was something else; some
secret which gave that man a hold over her. He stopped short
in the most crowded part of the Strand, and put his hand to his
brow and groaned.</p>

<p>To think that his Stella, his beautiful child-love, whom he had
deemed an angel for innocence, should share a secret with such
a man. And what was it? Was there shame connected with it?
He shuddered as the suspicion crossed his mind and smote upon
his heart. What had she done to place her so utterly in Jasper
Adelstone's hands? What was it? The question harassed and
worried him to the exclusion of all other sides of the case.</p>

<p>Was it something that had occurred before he, Leycester,
had met her? She had known this Jasper Adelstone before she
knew Leycester; but he remembered her speaking of him as a
conceited, self-opinioned young man; he remembered the light
scorn with which she had described him.</p>

<p>No, it could not have happened thus early. When then? and
where was it? He could find no solution to the question; but
the terrible result remained, that she had delivered herself, body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
and soul, into the hands of Jasper Adelstone, and was lost to
him, Leycester!</p>

<p>Striking along, careless of where he was going, he found himself
at last in Pall Mall. He entered one of his clubs, and went
to the smoking-room. There he lit a cigar, and took out the
marriage license and looked at it long and absently. If all had
gone right, Stella would have been his, if not by this time, a very
little later, and they would have gone to Italy, they two, together
and alone&mdash;with happiness.</p>

<p>But now it was all changed&mdash;the cup had been dashed from his
lips at the last moment, and by&mdash;Jasper Adelstone!</p>

<p>He sat, with the unsmoked cigar in his fingers, his head drooped
upon his breast, the nightmare of the secret mystery pressing on
his shoulders. It was not only the loss of Stella, it was the feeling
that she had deceived him that was so bitter to bear; it was
the existence of the secret understanding between the two that
so utterly overwhelmed him. He could have married Stella
though she had been a beggar in the streets, but he could have
no part or lot in the woman who shared a secret with such a
one as Jasper Adelstone.</p>

<p>The smoking-room footman hovered about, glancing covertly
and curiously at the motionless figure in the deep arm-chair;
acquaintances sauntered in and gave him good-bye; but Leycester
sat brooding over his sorrow and disappointment, and made
no response.</p>

<p>A more miserable young man it would have been impossible
to find in all London than this viscount and heir to an earldom,
with all his immense wealth and proud hereditary titles.</p>

<p>The afternoon came, hot and sultry, and to him suffocating.
The footman, beginning to be seriously alarmed by the quiescence
of the silent figure, was just considering whether it was
not his duty to bring him some refreshment, or rouse him by
offering him the paper, when Leycester rose, much to the man's
relief, and walked out.</p>

<p>Within the last few minutes he had decided upon some course
of action. He could not stay in London, he could not remain in
England; he would go abroad&mdash;go right out of the way, and
try and forget. He smiled to himself at the word, as if he
should ever forget the beautiful face that had lain upon his
breast, the exquisite eyes that had poured the lovelight into his,
the sweet girl-voice that had murmured its maiden confession
in his ear!</p>

<p>He called a cab, and told the man to drive to Waterloo;
caught a train, threw himself into a corner of the carriage, and
gave himself up to the bitterness of despair.</p>

<p>Dinner was just over when his tall figure passed along the
terrace, and the ladies were standing under the drawing-room
veranda enjoying the sunset. A little apart from the rest
stood Lenore. She was leaning against one of the iron columns,
her dress of white cashmere and satin trimmed with
pearls standing out daintily and fairy-like against the mass of
ferns and flowers behind her.</p>

<p>She was leaning in the most graceful air of abandon, her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
sunshade lying at her feet, her hands folded with an indolent
air of rest on her lap; there was a serene smile upon her lips, a
delicate languor in her violet eyes, an altogether
at-peace-with-all-the-world expression which was in direct
contrast with the faint expression of anxiety which rested on the
handsome face of the countess.</p>

<p>Every now and then, as the proud and haughty woman, but
anxious mother, chatted and laughed with the women around
her, her gaze wandered to the open country with an absent, almost
fearful expression, and once, as the sound of a carriage was
heard on the drive, she was actually guilty of a start.</p>

<p>But the carriage was only that of one of the guests, and the
countess sighed and turned to her duties again. Lenore, with
head thrown back, watched her with a lazy smile. She was
suffering likewise, but she had something tangible to fear, something
definite to hope; the mother knew nothing, but feared all
things.</p>

<p>Presently Lady Wyndward happened to come within the scope
of Lenore's voice.</p>

<p>"You look tired to-night, dear," she said.</p>

<p>The countess smiled, wearily.</p>

<p>"I will admit a little headache," she said; then she looked at
the lovely indolent face. "You look well enough, Lenore!"</p>

<p>Lady Lenore smiled, curiously.</p>

<p>"Do you think so!" she answered. "Suppose I also confessed
a headache!"</p>

<p>"I should outdo you even then," said the countess, with a sigh,
"for I have a heartache!"</p>

<p>Lenore put out her hand, white and glittering with pearls and
diamonds, and laid it on the elder woman's arm with a little caressing
gesture peculiar to her.</p>

<p>"Tell me dear," she whispered.</p>

<p>The countess shook her head.</p>

<p>"I cannot," she said, with a sigh. "I scarcely know myself.
I am quite in the dark, but I know that something has happened
or is happening. You know that Leycester went suddenly yesterday?"</p>

<p>Lady Lenore moved her head in assent.</p>

<p>The countess sighed.</p>

<p>"I am always fearful of him."</p>

<p>Lenore laughed, softly.</p>

<p>"So am I. But I am not fearful on this occasion. Wait until
he comes back."</p>

<p>The countess shook her head.</p>

<p>"When will that be? I am afraid not for some time!"</p>

<p>"I think he will come back to-night," said Lenore, with a
smile that was too placid to be confident or boastful.</p>

<p>The countess smiled and looked at her.</p>

<p>"You are a strange girl, Lenore," she said. "What makes
you think that?"</p>

<p>Lenore turned the bracelet on her arm.</p>

<p>"Something seems to whisper to me that he will come," she
said. "Look!" And she just moved her hand toward the terrace.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Leycester was coming slowly up the broad stone steps.</p>

<p>Lady Wyndward made a move forward, but Lenore's hand
closed over her arm, and she stopped and looked at her.</p>

<p>Lenore shook her head, smiling softly.</p>

<p>"Better not," she murmured, scarcely above her breath.
"Not yet. Leave him alone. Something has happened as you
surmised. I have such keen eyes, you know, and can see his
face."</p>

<p>So could Lady Wyndward by this time, and her own turned
white at sight of the pale, haggard face.</p>

<p>"Do not go to him," whispered Lenore, "do not stop him.
Leave him alone; it is good advice."</p>

<p>Lady Wyndward felt instinctively that it was, and so that she
might not be tempted to disregard it, she turned away and went
into the house.</p>

<p>Leycester came along the terrace, and raising his eyes, heavy
and clouded, saw the ladies, but he only raised his hat and passed
on. Then he came to where the figure in white, glimmering
with pearls and diamonds, leaned against the column and he
hesitated a moment, but there was no look of invitation in her
eyes, only a faint smile, and he merely raised his hat again and
passed on; but, half unconsciously, he had taken in the loveliness
and grace of the picture that she made, and that was all
that she desired for the present.</p>

<p>With heavy steps he crossed the hall, climbed the stairs, and
entered his own room.</p>

<p>His man Oliver, who had been waiting for him and hanging
about, came in softly, but stole out again at sight of the dusky
figure lying wearily on the chair; but presently Leycester called
him and he went back.</p>

<p>"Get a bath ready, Oliver," he said, "and pack a portmanteau;
we shall leave to-night."</p>

<p>"Very good, my lord," was the quiet response, and then he
went to prepare the bath.</p>

<p>Leycester got up and strode to and fro. Though she had never
entered his rooms, the apartments seemed full of her; from the
easel stared the disfigured Venus which he had daubed out on
the first night he had seen her. On the table, in an Etruscan
vase of crystal, were some of the wild flowers which her hand
had plucked, her lips had pressed. These he took&mdash;not fiercely
but solemnly&mdash;and threw out of the window.</p>

<p>Suddenly there floated upon the air the strains of solemn
music. He started. He had almost forgotten Lilian; the
great sorrow and misery had almost driven her from his memory.
He sat the vase down upon the table, and went to her
room; she knew his knock, and bade him come in, still playing.</p>

<p>But as he entered, she stopped suddenly, and the smile which
had flown to her face to welcome him disappeared.</p>

<p>"Ley!" she breathed, looking up at his pale, haggard face
and dark-rimmed eyes; "what has happened? What is the matter?"</p>

<p>He stood beside her, and bent and kissed her; his lips were dry
and burning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ley! Ley!" she murmured, and put her white arm round
his neck to draw him down to her, "what is it?"</p>

<p>Then she scanned him with loving anxiety.</p>

<p>"How tired you look, Ley! Where have you been? Sit
down!"</p>

<p>He sank into a low seat at her feet, and motioned to the
piano.</p>

<p>"Go on playing," he said.</p>

<p>She started at his hoarse, dry voice, but turned to the piano,
and played softly, and presently she knew, rather than saw, that
he had hidden his face in his hands.</p>

<p>Then she stopped and bent over him.</p>

<p>"Now tell me, Ley!" she murmured.</p>

<p>He looked up with a bitter smile that cut her to the heart.</p>

<p>"It is soon told, Lil," he said, in a low voice, "and it is only
an old, old story!"</p>

<p>"Ley!"</p>

<p>"I can tell you&mdash;I could tell only you, Lil&mdash;in a very few
words. I have loved&mdash;and been deceived."</p>

<p>She did not speak, but she put her hand on his head where it
lay like a peaceful benediction.</p>

<p>"I have staked my all, all my happiness and peace, upon a
cast and have lost. I am very badly hit, and naturally I feel it
very badly for a time!"</p>

<p>"Ley!" she murmured, reproachfully, "you must not talk to
<i>me</i> like this; speak from your heart."</p>

<p>"I haven't any left, Lil!" he said; "there is only an aching
void where my heart used to be. I lost it weeks ago&mdash;or was it
months or years? I can't tell which now!&mdash;and she to whom I
gave it, she whom I thought an angel of purity, a dove of innocence,
has thrown it in the dirt and trampled upon it!"</p>

<p>"Ley, Ley, you torture me! Of whom are you speaking?"</p>

<p>"Of whom should I be speaking but the one woman the world
holds for me?"</p>

<p>"Lenore!" she murmured, incredulously.</p>

<p>"Lenore!" and he laughed bitterly. "No; she did not pronounce
her name so. I am speaking and thinking of Stella
Etheridge."</p>

<p>Her hand trembled, but she did not withdraw it.</p>

<p>"Stella?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, and his lips twitched. "A star. A star that
will shine in another man's bosom, not in mine as I, fool that I
was, dreamed that it would. Lil, I believe that there is only
one good woman in the world, and she sits near me now."</p>

<p>"Oh, Ley, Ley&mdash;but tell me!"</p>

<p>"There is so little to tell," he said, wearily. "I cannot tell
you all. This will suffice, that to-night I expected and hoped to
have been able to call her my wife, instead&mdash;well, you see, I am
sitting here!"</p>

<p>"Your wife?" she murmured. "Stella Etheridge your wife.
Was that&mdash;that wise, Ley?"</p>

<p>"Wise! What have I to do with wisdom?" he retorted. "I
loved her&mdash;loved her passionately, madly, as I never, nor shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
ever, love another woman! Heaven help me, I love her now!
Don't you see that is the worst part of it. I know, as surely as
I am sitting here, that my life has gone. It has gone to pieces
on the rocks like a goodly ship, and there is an end of it!"</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment, then she spoke, and, woman-like,
her thoughts were of the woman.</p>

<p>"But she, Ley? How is it with her?"</p>

<p>He laughed again, and the gentle girl shuddered.</p>

<p>"Don't Ley," she murmured.</p>

<p>"She will be all right," he said. "Women are made like that&mdash;all
excepting one," and he touched her dress.</p>

<p>"And yet&mdash;and yet," she murmured, troubled and sorrowful,
"now I look back I am sure that she loved you, Ley! I remember
her face, the look of her eyes, the way she spoke your name.
Oh, Ley, she loved you!"</p>

<p>"She did&mdash;perhaps. She loves me now so well, that on our
wedding-day&mdash;wedding-day!&mdash;she allows a man to step in between
us and claim her as his own!"</p>

<p>Maddened by the memory which her words had called up he
would have risen, but she held him down with a gentle hand.</p>

<p>"A man! What man, Ley?"</p>

<p>"One called Jasper Adelstone, a lawyer; a man it would be
gross flattery to call even a gentleman! Think of it, Lil. Picture
it! I wait to receive my bride, and instead of it happening
so, I am sent for to meet her at this man's chambers. There
I am informed that all is over between us, and that she is the
affianced wife of Mr. Jasper Adelstone."</p>

<p>"But the reason&mdash;the reason?"</p>

<p>"There is none!" he exclaimed, rising and pacing the room,
"I am vouchsafed no reason. The bare facts are deemed sufficient
for me. I am cast adrift, as something no longer necessary
or needful, without word of reason or even of rhyme!"
and he laughed.</p>

<p>She was silent for a moment, then a murmur broke from her
lips.</p>

<p>"Poor girl!"</p>

<p>He stooped and looked down at her.</p>

<p>"Do not waste your pity, Lil," he said, with a grim smile.
"With her own lips she declared that what she did she did of
her own free will!"</p>

<p>"With this man standing by her side?"</p>

<p>He started, then he shook his head.</p>

<p>"I know what you mean!" he said, hoarsely. "And do you
not see that that is the worst of it. She is in his power; there
is some secret understanding between them. Can I marry a
woman who is in another man's power so completely that she
is forced to break her word to me, to jilt me for him!&mdash;can I?"</p>

<p>His voice was so hoarse and harsh as to be almost inarticulate,
and he stood with outstretched, appealing hands, as if demanding
an answer.</p>

<p>What could she say? For a moment she was silent, then she
put out her hand to him.</p>

<p>"And you have left her with him, Ley?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>The question sent all the blood from his face.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, wearily, "I have left her with her future
husband. Possibly, probably, by this time she has become his
wife. One man can procure a marriage license as easily as another."</p>

<p>"You did that! What would papa and my mother have
said?" she murmured.</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>"What did, what should I care? I tell you I loved her madly;
you do not know, cannot understand what such love means!
Know, then, Lil, that I would rather have died than lose her&mdash;that,
having lost her, life has become void and barren for me&mdash;that
the days and hours until I forget her will be so much
time of torture and regret, and vain, useless longing. I shall
see her face, hear her voice, wherever I may be, in the day or in
the night; and no pleasure, no pain will efface her from my
memory or my heart."</p>

<p>"Oh, Ley!&mdash;my poor Ley!"</p>

<p>"Thus it is with me. And now I have come to say 'good-bye.'"</p>

<p>"Good-bye. You are going&mdash;where?"</p>

<p>"Where?" he echoed, with the same discordant laugh. "I
neither know nor care. I am afraid all places will be alike for
awhile. The whole earth is full of her; there is not a wild
flower that will not remind me of her, not a sound of music that
will not recall her voice. If I meet a woman I shall compare
her with my Stella&mdash;<i>my</i> Stella! no, Jasper Adelstone's! Oh,
Heaven! I could bear all but that. If she were dead, I should
have at least one comfort&mdash;the consolation of knowing that she
had belonged to no other man&mdash;that in some other remote world
we might meet again, and I might claim her as mine! But that
is denied to me. My white angel is stained and besmirched, and
is mine no longer!"</p>

<p>Worn out by the passion of his grief, he dropped on the seat
at her feet, and hid his face in his hands.</p>

<p>She put her arm round his neck, but spoke no word. Words
at such moments are like gnats round a wound&mdash;they can only
irritate, they cannot heal.</p>

<p>They sat thus motionless for some minutes, then he rose,
calmer but very white and worn.</p>

<p>"This is weak of me, worse than weak, inconsiderate, Lil," he
said, with a wan smile. "You have so much of your own sorrows
that you should be spared the recital of other people's
woes. I will go now. Good-bye, Lil!"</p>

<p>"Oh, what can I do for you?" she murmured. "My dear!
My dear!"</p>

<p>He stooped and kissed her, and looked down at her pale face
so full of sorrow for his sorrow, and his heart grew calmer and
more resigned.</p>

<p>"Nothing, Lil," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said in a low voice; "if I can do nothing else I
can pray for you, Ley!"</p>

<p>He smiled and stroked her hair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are an angel, Lil," he said, softly. "If all women
were made like you, there would be no sin and little sorrow in
the world. In the future that lies black and drear before me I
shall think of you. Yes, pray for me, Lil. Good-bye!" and he
kissed her again.</p>

<p>She held him to the last, then when he had gone she buried
her face in her hands and cried. But suddenly she sat up and
touched the bell that stood near her.</p>

<p>"Crying will do no good for my Ley," she murmured. "I
must do more than that. Oh, if I could be strong and hale like
other girls for an hour, one short hour! But I will, I must do
something! I cannot see him suffer so and do nothing!"</p>

<p>Her one special maid, a girl who had been with her since her
childhood and knew every mood and change in her, came in and
hurried to her side at the sight of her tear-dimmed eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lady Lilian, what is the matter? You have been crying!"</p>

<p>"A little, Jeanette," she said, smiling through her tears. "I
am in great trouble&mdash;Lord Leycester is in great trouble&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have just met him, my lady, looking so ill and worried."</p>

<p>"Yes, Jeanette; he is in great trouble, and I want to help
him," and then, with fear and trembling, she announced an intention
she had suddenly formed. Jeanette was aghast for a
time, but at last she yielded, and hurried away to make the preparation
for the execution of her beloved mistress's wishes.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the door closed on Lord Leycester, Stella's heart seemed to
leave her bosom; it was as if all hope had fled with him, and as
if her doom was irrevocably fixed. For a moment she did not
realize that she was leaning upon Jasper Adelstone for support,
but when her numbed senses woke to a capacity for fresh pain,
and she felt his hand touching hers, she shrank away from him
with a shudder, and summoning all her presence of mind, turned
to him calmly:</p>

<p>"You have worked your will," she said, in a low voice. "What
remains? What other commands have you to lay upon me?"</p>

<p>He winced, and the color struggled to his pale face.</p>

<p>"In the future," he said, in a low voice, "it will be your place
to command, mine to obey those commands, willingly, cheerfully."</p>

<p>Stella waved her hand with weary impatience.</p>

<p>"I am in your hands," she said; "what am I to do now? where
am I to go? No! I know that; I will go back&mdash;&mdash;" then she
stopped, and a look of pain and fear came upon her beautiful
face as she thought of the alarm with which her uncle would
discover her flight, and the explanation which he would demand.
"How can I go back? What can I say?"</p>

<p>"I have thought of that," he said, in a low voice. "I had foreseen
the difficulty, and I have provided against it. I know that
what I have done may only increase your anger, but I did it for
the best."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>"What have you done?" asked Stella.</p>

<p>"I have telegraphed to your uncle to say that I had tempted you
and Frank to run up to town, and that I would bring you back
this evening. I knew he would not be anxious then, seeing that
Frank was with you."</p>

<p>Stella stared at the firm, self-reliant face. He had provided
for every contingency, had foreseen everything, and had evidently
felt so assured of the success of his plans. She could not refrain
a slight shudder as she realized what sort of a man this was
who held her in his power. She felt that it were as useless to
attempt to escape him as it would be for a bird to flutter against
the bars of its cage.</p>

<p>"Have I done wrong?" he asked, standing beside her, his head
bent, his whole attitude one of deference and humility.</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"No, I suppose not. It does not matter if he can be spared
pain."</p>

<p>"He shall be," he responded. "I will do all in my power to render
both him and you and Frank happy."</p>

<p>She looked at him with a pitiful smile.</p>

<p>"Happy!"</p>

<p>"Yes, happy!" he repeated, with low but intense emphasis. "Remember,
that, though I have won you by force, I love you; that
I would die for you, yes, die for you, if need were&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She rose&mdash;she had sunk into a chair&mdash;and put her hand to her
brow.</p>

<p>"Let me go now, please," she said, wearily.</p>

<p>He put on his hat, but stopped her with a gesture.</p>

<p>"Frank," he said.</p>

<p>She knew what he meant, and inclined her head.</p>

<p>Jasper went to the door and called him by name, and he entered.
Jasper laid his hand on his shoulder and kept it there
firmly, notwithstanding the boy's endeavor to shrink away from
him.</p>

<p>"Frank," he said, in his low, quiet voice, "I want to say a few
words to you. Let me preface them with the statement that what
I am going to say your cousin Stella fully endorses."</p>

<p>Frank, looking at Stella&mdash;he had not taken his eyes from her
face&mdash;said:</p>

<p>"Is that so, Stella?"</p>

<p>She inclined her head.</p>

<p>"I want you," said Jasper&mdash;"we want you, we ask you, my dear
Frank, to erase from your memory all that has occurred here
this morning, and before that; remember only that your cousin
Stella is my affianced wife. I am aware that the suddenness of
the thing causes you surprise, as is only natural; but get over
that surprise, and learn, as soon as possible, to recognize it as an
inevitable fact. Of all that has passed between&mdash;between"&mdash;he
hesitated at the hated name, and drew a little breath&mdash;"Lord Leycester
and Stella, nothing remains&mdash;nothing! We will forget all
that, will we not, Stella?"</p>

<p>She made the same gesture.</p>

<p>"And we ask you to do the same."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>"But!" exclaimed Frank, white with suppressed excitement
and indignation.</p>

<p>Jasper glanced at Stella, almost with an air of command, and
Stella went over to Frank and laying her hand on his arm, bent
and kissed him.</p>

<p>"It must be so, dear," she said in a low tremulous whisper.
"Do not ask me why, but believe it. It is as he has said, inevitable.
Every word from you in the shape of a question will
add to my mis&mdash;will only pain me. Do not speak, dear, for my
sake!"</p>

<p>He looked from one to the other, then he took her hand with
a curious expression in his face.</p>

<p>"I will not ask," he said. "I will be silent for your sake."</p>

<p>She pressed his hand and let it drop.</p>

<p>"Come!" said Jasper with a smile, "that is the right way to
take it, my dear Frank. Now let me say a word for myself, it
is this, that you do not possess a truer friend and one more willing
and anxious to serve you than Jasper Adelstone. Is that
not so?" and he looked at Stella.</p>

<p>"Yes," she breathed.</p>

<p>Frank stood with his eyes cast down; he raised them for a moment
and looked Jasper full in the face, then lowered them again.</p>

<p>"And now," said Jasper, with a smile and in a lighter voice,
"you must take some refreshment," and he went to the cupboard
and brought out some wine. Frank turned away, but
Stella, nerving and forcing herself, took the glass he extended to
her and put the edge to her lips.</p>

<p>Jasper seemed satisfied, though he saw that she had not touched
a drop.</p>

<p>"Let me see," he said, taking out his watch, "there is a train
back in half an hour. Shall we catch that?"</p>

<p>"Are you coming back with us?" said Frank in a quiet
voice.</p>

<p>Jasper nodded.</p>

<p>"If you will allow me, my dear Frank," he said, calmly. "I
won't keep you a moment."</p>

<p>He rang the bell as he spoke and Scrivell entered.</p>

<p>There was no sign of any kind either in his face or his bearing
that he was conscious of anything out of the ordinary having
happened; he came in with his young old face and colorless
eyes, and stood waiting patiently. Jasper handed him some
letters, and gave him instructions in a business tone, then asked
if the brougham was waiting.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Scrivell.</p>

<p>"Come then!" said Jasper, and Scrivell held the door open
and bowed with the deepest respect as they passed out.</p>

<p>It was so sudden a change from the storm of passion that had
just passed over them all, that Frank and Stella felt bewildered
and benumbed, which was exactly as Jasper wished them to
feel.</p>

<p>His manner was deferential and humble but fully self-possessed;
he put Stella in the brougham, and insisted quietly upon
Frank sitting beside her, he himself taking the front seat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>Stella shrank back into the corner, and lowered her veil.
Frank sat staring out of the window, and avoiding even a
glance at the face opposite him. Jasper made no attempt to
break the silence, but sat, his eyes fixed on the passers-by, the
calm, inscrutable expression on his face never faltering, though
a triumph ran through his veins.</p>

<p>The train was waiting, and he put them into a carriage,
lowered the window and drew the curtain for Stella, and at the
last moment bought a bunch of flowers at the refreshment-bar,
and laid it beside her. Then he got in and unfolded a newspaper
and looked through it.</p>

<p>Scarcely a word was spoken during the whole journey; it was
an express train, but it seemed ages to Stella before it drew up
at Wyndward Station.</p>

<p>Jasper helped her to alight, she just touching his hand with
her gloved fingers, and they walked across the meadow. As
they came in sight of the Hall, shining whitely in the evening
sunlight, Stella raised her eyes and looked at it, and a cold hand
seemed to grasp her heart. As if he knew what was passing in
her mind, Jasper took her sunshade and put it up.</p>

<p>"The sun is still hot," he said; and he held it so as to shut the
hall from her sight.</p>

<p>They came to the lane&mdash;to the spot where Stella had stood up
on the bank and looked down at the upturned eyes which she
had learned to love; she breathed a silent prayer that she might
never see them again.</p>

<p>Jasper opened the gate, and a smile began to form on his lips.</p>

<p>"Prepare for a scolding," he said, lightly. "You must put
all the blame on me."</p>

<p>But there was no scolding; the old man was seated in his arm-chair,
and eyed them with mild surprise and anxiety.</p>

<p>"Stella," he said, "where have you been? We have been
very anxious. How pale and tired you look!"</p>

<p>Jasper almost stepped before her to screen her.</p>

<p>"It is all my fault, my dear sir," he said. "Lay the blame
on me. I ought to have known better, I admit, but I met the
young people on their morning stroll and tempted them to take
a run to town. It was done on the spur of the moment. You
must forgive us!"</p>

<p>Mr. Etheridge looked from one to the other and patted Stella's
arm.</p>

<p>"You must ask Mrs. Penfold," he said, with a smile. "She
will be difficult to appease, I'm afraid. We have been very anxious.
It was&mdash;well, unlike you, Stella."</p>

<p>"I hope I shall be able to appease Mrs. Penfold," said Jasper.
"I want her good word; I know she has some influence with
you, sir."</p>

<p>He paused, and the old man looked up, struck by some significance
in his tone.</p>

<p>Jasper stood looking down at him with a little smile of pleading
interrogation.</p>

<p>"I have come as a suppliant for your forgiveness on more accounts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
than one," he continued. "I have dared to ask Stella
to be my wife, sir."</p>

<p>Stella started, but still looked out beyond him at the green
hills and the water glowing in the sunset. Mr. Etheridge put
his hand on her head and turned her face.</p>

<p>"Stella!"</p>

<p>"You wish to know what she has answered, sir," said Jasper
to spare Stella making any reply. "With a joy I cannot express,
I am able to say that she has answered 'Yes.'"</p>

<p>"Is that so, my dear?" murmured the old man.</p>

<p>Stella's head drooped.</p>

<p>"This&mdash;this&mdash;surprises me!" he said in a low voice. "But if it
is so, if you love him, my dear, I will not say 'No.' Heaven
bless you, Stella!" and his hand rested upon her head.</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment, then he started and held out
his other hand to Jasper.</p>

<p>"You are a fortunate man, Jasper," he said. "I hope, I trust
you will make her happy!"</p>

<p>Jasper's small eyes glistened.</p>

<p>"I will answer for it with my life," he said.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">"Oh</span>, my love, my love!"</p>

<p>She stood with her arms outstretched toward the white walls
of the Hall, the moon shining over meadow and river, the night
jay creaking in silence.</p>

<p>In all her anguish and misery, in all her passionate longing
and sorrow, these were the only words that her lips could frame.
All was still in the house behind her. Frank, worn out with excitement,
had gone to his own room. The old man sat smoking,
dreaming and thinking of his little girl's betrothal. Jasper had
gone&mdash;he was too wise to prolong the strain which he knew she
was enduring&mdash;and she had crept out into the little garden and
stood leaning against the gate, her eyes fixed on the great house,
which at that moment perhaps held him&mdash;Leycester&mdash;who, a few
short hours ago, was hers, and in a low voice the cry broke from
her lips:</p>

<p>"Oh, my love, my love!"</p>

<p>It was a benediction, a farewell, a prayer, in one; all her soul
seemed melting and flowing toward him in the wail. All the intense
longing of her passionate nature to fly to his protecting
arms and tell him all&mdash;to tell him that she still loved him as the
flowers love the sun, the hart the waterbrook&mdash;was expressed in
the words; then, as she remembered he could not hear them&mdash;that
it would avail nothing if he could hear them, her face
dropped into her hands, and she shut out the Hall from her hot,
burning eyes. She had not yet shed one tear; if she could but
have wept, the awful tightening round her brain, the burning
fire in her eyes, would have been assuaged; but she could not
weep, she was held in thrall, benumbed by the calamity that had
befallen her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>She, who was to have been Leycester's bride, was now the betrothed
of&mdash;Jasper Adelstone.</p>

<p>And yet, as she stood there, alone in her misery, she knew that
were it to be done again she would do it. To keep shame and
disgrace from the old man who loved her as a father&mdash;the boy
who loved her as a brother, she would have laid down her life;
but this was more than life. The sacrifice demanded of her, and
which she had yielded, was worse than death.</p>

<p>Death! She looked up at the blue vault of heaven with aching,
longing eyes. If she could but die&mdash;die there and then, before
Jasper could lay his hand upon her! If she could but die,
so that he, Leycester, might come and see her lying cold and
white, but still his&mdash;his! He would know then that she loved
him, that without him she would not accept even life. He
would look down at her with the odd light in his dark eyes,
perhaps stoop and kiss her&mdash;and now he would never kiss her
again!</p>

<p>How often have blind mortals clamored to the gods for this
one boon which they will not yield. When sorrow comes, the
cry goes up&mdash;"Give us death!" but the gods turn a deaf ear to
the prayer. "Live," they say, "the cup is not yet drained; the
task is not yet done."</p>

<p>And she was young, she thought, with a sigh, "so young,
and so strong," she might live for&mdash;for years! Oh, the long,
dreary vista of years that stretched before her, down which
she would drag with tired feet as Jasper Adelstone's wife.
No thought of appealing to him, to his mercy, ever occurred to
her; she had learned to know him, during that short hour in
London, so well as to know that any such appeal would be useless.
The sphinx rearing its immovable head above the dreary
desert could not be more steadfast, more unyielding than this
man who held her in his grasp.</p>

<p>"No," she murmured, "I have taken up this burden; I must
carry it to the end. Would to Heaven that end were nigh."</p>

<p>She turned with dragging step toward the house, scarcely
hearing, utterly heedless of the sound of approaching wheels;
even when they stopped outside the gate she did not notice; but
suddenly a voice cried, in low and tremulous accents, "Stella!"
and she turned, with her hand pressed to her bosom. She knew
the voice, and it went to her heart like a knife. It was not <i>his</i>,
but so like, so like.</p>

<p>She turned and started, for there, standing in the moonlight,
leaning on the arm of her maid, was Lady Lilian.</p>

<p>The two stood for a moment regarding each other in silence,
then Stella came nearer.</p>

<p>Lady Lilian held out her hand, and Stella came and took her
by her arm.</p>

<p>"Wait for me in the lane, Jeanette," said Lady Lilian. "You
will let me lean on you, Stella," she added, softly.</p>

<p>Stella took her and led her to a seat, and the two sat in silence.
Stella with her eyes on the ground, Lilian with hers fixed on the
pale, lovely face&mdash;more lovely even than when she had last seen
it, flushed with happiness and love's anticipation. A pang shot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
through the tender heart of the sick girl as she noted the dark
rings under the beautiful eyes, the tightly drawn lips, the wan,
weary face.</p>

<p>"Stella," she murmured, and put her arm round her.</p>

<p>Stella turned her face; it was almost hard in her effort at self-control.</p>

<p>"Lady Lilian&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lilian&mdash;only Lilian."</p>

<p>"You have come here&mdash;so late!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have come, Stella," she murmured, and the tears
sprang to her eyes, drawn thither by the sound of the other
voice, so sad and so hopeless. "I could not rest, dear. You
would have come to me, Stella, if I had&mdash;if it had happened
to me!"</p>

<p>Stella's lips moved.</p>

<p>"Perhaps."</p>

<p>Lilian took her hand&mdash;hot and feverish and restless.</p>

<p>"Stella, you must not be angry with me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A wan smile flickered on the pale face.</p>

<p>"Angry! Look at me. There is nothing that could happen
to-night that would rouse me to anger."</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear, my dear! you frighten me!"</p>

<p>Stella looked at her with awful calm.</p>

<p>"Do I?" Then her voice dropped. "I am almost frightened
at myself. Why have you come?" she asked almost sharply.</p>

<p>"Because I thought you needed me&mdash;some one, some girl
young like yourself. Do not send me away, Stella. You will
hear what I have come to say?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I will hear," said Stella, wearily, "though no words
that can be spoken will help me, none."</p>

<p>"Stella, I&mdash;I have heard&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Stella looked at her, and her lips quivered.</p>

<p>"You have seen him&mdash;he has told you?" she breathed.</p>

<p>Lilian bent her head.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, I have seen him. Oh, Stella, if you had seen him
as I have done!&mdash;if you had heard him speak! His voice&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Stella put up her hand.</p>

<p>"Don't!&mdash;Spare me!" she uttered, hoarsely.</p>

<p>"But why&mdash;why should it be?" murmured Lilian, clinging to
her hand. "Why, Stella, you cannot guess how he loves you?
There never was love so deep, so pure, so true as his!"</p>

<p>A faint flush broke over the pale face.</p>

<p>"I know it," she breathed. Then, with a sharp, almost fierce
energy, "Have you come to tell me that&mdash;me who know him so
well? Was it worth while? Do you think I do not know what
I have lost?"</p>

<p>"You promised not to be angry with me, Stella."</p>

<p>"Forgive me&mdash;I&mdash;I scarcely know what I am saying! You did
not come for that; what then?"</p>

<p>"To hear from your own lips, Stella, the reason for this.
Bear with me, dear! Remember that I am his sister, that I
love him with a love only second to yours! That all my life I
have loved him, and that my heart is breaking at the sight of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
his unhappiness. I have come to tell you this&mdash;to plead for him&mdash;to
plead with you for yourself! Do not turn a deaf ear, a cold
heart to me, Stella! Do not, do not!" and she clung to the hot
hands, and looked up at the white face with tearful, imploring
eyes.</p>

<p>"You say you know him; you may do so; but not so well as
I, his sister. I know every turn of his nature&mdash;am I not of the
same flesh and blood? Stella, he is not like other men&mdash;quick
to change and forget. He will never bend and turn as other
men. Stella, you will break his heart!"</p>

<p>Stella turned on her like some tortured animal driven to bay.</p>

<p>"Do I not know it! Is it not this knowledge that is breaking
my heart&mdash;that has already broken it?" she retorted wildly.
"Do you think I am sorrowing for myself alone? Do you think
me so mean, so selfish? Listen, Lady Lilian, if&mdash;if this separation
were to bring him happiness I could have borne it with a
smile. If you could come to me and say, 'He will forget you
and his love in a week&mdash;a month&mdash;a year!' I would welcome
you as one who brings me consolation and hope. Who am I that
I should think of myself alone?&mdash;I, the miserable, insignificant
girl whom he condescended to bless with his love! I am&mdash;nothing!
Nothing save what his love made me. If my life
could have purchased his happiness I would have given it.
Lady Lilian you do not know me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The tempest of her passion overawed the other weak and
trembling girl.</p>

<p>"You love him so!" she murmured.</p>

<p>Stella looked at her with a smile.</p>

<p>"I love him," she said, slowly. "I will never say it again,
never! I say it to you that you may know and understand how
deep and wide is the gulf which stretches between us&mdash;so wide
that it can never, never be overpassed."</p>

<p>"No, no, you shall not say it."</p>

<p>Stella smiled bitterly.</p>

<p>"I think I know why you have come, Lilian. You think this
a mere lovers' quarrel, that a word will set straight. Quarrel!
How little you know either him or me. There never could have
been a quarrel between us&mdash;one cannot quarrel with oneself!
His word, his wish were law to me. If he had said 'do this,' I
should have done it&mdash;if he had said 'go thither,' I should have
gone; but once he laid his command on me, and I obeyed. There
is nothing I would not have done&mdash;nothing, if he had bidden
me. I know it now&mdash;I know now that I was like a reed in his
hands now that I have lost him."</p>

<p>Lilian put her hand upon her lips.</p>

<p>"You shall not say it!" she murmured, hoarsely. "Nothing
can part you&mdash;nothing can stand against such love! You are
right. I never knew what it meant until to-night. Stella, you
cannot mean to send him away&mdash;you will not let anything save
death come between you?"</p>

<p>Stella looked at her with aching eyes that, unlike Lilian's,
were dry and tearless.</p>

<p>"Death!" she said, "there are things worse than death&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>"Stella!"</p>

<p>"Words one cannot mention, lest the winds should catch them
up and spread them far and wide. Not even death could have
divided us more effectually than we are divided."</p>

<p>Lilian shrank back appalled.</p>

<p>"What is it you say?" she breathed. "Stella, look at me!
You will, you must tell me what you mean."</p>

<p>Stella did look at her, with a look that was awful in its calm
despair.</p>

<p>"I was silent when <i>he</i> bade me speak; do you think that I can
open my lips to you?"</p>

<p>Lilian hid her face in her hand, tremblingly.</p>

<p>"Oh, what is it?&mdash;what is it?" she murmured.</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment, then Stella laid her hand on
Lilian's arm.</p>

<p>"Listen," she said, solemnly. "I will tell you this much,
that you may understand how hopeless is the task which you
have undertaken. If&mdash;if I were to yield, if I were to say to him
'Come back! I am yours, take me!' you&mdash;<i>you</i>, who plead so
that my heart aches at your words&mdash;would, in the coming time,
when the storm broke and the cost of my yielding had to be
paid&mdash;you would be the first to say that I had done wrong, weakly,
selfishly. You would be the first, because you are a woman,
and know that it is a woman's duty to sacrifice herself for those
she loves! Have I made it plain?"</p>

<p>Lilian raised her head and looked at her, and her face went
white.</p>

<p>"Is&mdash;is that true?"</p>

<p>"It is so true, that if I were to tell you what separates us, you
would go without a word; no! you would utter that word in a
prayer that I might remain as firm and unyielding as I am!"</p>

<p>So utterly hopeless were the words, the voice, that they smote
on the gentle heart with the force of conviction. She was silent
for a moment, then, with a sob, she held out her arms.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear, my dear! Stella, Stella!" she sobbed.</p>

<p>Stella looked at her for a moment, then she bent and kissed
her.</p>

<p>"Do not cry," she murmured, no tear in her own eye. "I can
not cry, I feel as if I shall never shed another tear! Go now
go!" and she put her arm round her.</p>

<p>Lilian rose trembling, and leant upon her, looking up into her
face.</p>

<p>"My poor Stella!" she murmured. "He&mdash;he called you noble;
I know now what he meant! I think I understand&mdash;I am not
sure, even now; but I think, and&mdash;and, yes, I will say it, I feel
that you are right. But, oh, my dear, my dear!"</p>

<p>"Hush! hush!" breathed Stella, painfully. "Do not pity
me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pity! It is a poor, a miserable word between us. I love, I
honor you, Stella!" and she put her arm round Stella's neck.
"Kiss me, dear, once!"</p>

<p>Stella bent and kissed her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>"Once&mdash;and for the last time," she said, in a low voice.
"Henceforth we must be strangers."</p>

<p>"Not that, Stella; that is impossible, knowing what we do!"</p>

<p>"Yes, it must be," was the low, calm response. "I could not
bear it. There must be nothing to remind me of&mdash;him," and her
lips quivered.</p>

<p>Lilian's head drooped.</p>

<p>"Oh, my poor boy!" she moaned. "Stella," she said, in a
pleading whisper, "give me one word to comfort him&mdash;one
word?"</p>

<p>Stella turned her eyes upon her; they had reached the gate,
the carriage was in sight.</p>

<p>"There is no word that I can send," she said, almost inaudibly.
"No word but this&mdash;that nothing he can do can save us, that
any effort will but add to my misery, and that I pray we may
never meet again."</p>

<p>"I cannot tell him that! Not that, Stella!"</p>

<p>"It is the best wish I can have," said Stella, "I do wish it&mdash;for
myself, and for him. I pray that we never meet again."</p>

<p>Lilian clung to her to the last, even when she had entered the
carriage, and to the last there was no tear in the dark sorrowful
eyes. White and weary she stood, looking out into the night,
worn out and exhausted by the struggle and the storm of pent-up
emotion, but fixed and immovable as only a woman can be
when she has resolved on self-sacrifice.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, Lilian stood on the threshold of Leycester's
room. She had knocked twice, scarcely daring to use her
voice, but at last she spoke his name, and he opened the door.</p>

<p>"Lilian!" he said, and he took her in his arms.</p>

<p>"Shut the door," she breathed.</p>

<p>Then she sank on to his breast and looked up at him, all her
love and devotion in her sorrowful eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, my poor darling," she murmured.</p>

<p>He started and drew her to the light.</p>

<p>"What is it! Where have you been?" he asked, and there
was a faint sound of hope in his voice, a faint light in his haggard
face, as she whispered&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have seen her!"</p>

<p>"Seen her&mdash;Stella?"</p>

<p>And his voice quivered on the name.</p>

<p>"Yes. Oh, Ley! Ley!"</p>

<p>His face blanched.</p>

<p>"Well!" he said, hoarsely.</p>

<p>"Ley, my poor Ley! there is no hope."</p>

<p>His grasp tightened on her arm.</p>

<p>"No hope!" he echoed wearily.</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"Ley, I do not wonder at you loving her! She is the type of
all that is beautiful and noble&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you torture me!" he said, brokenly.</p>

<p>"So good and true and noble," she continued, sobbing; "and
because she is all this and more you must learn to bear it,
Ley!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>He smiled bitterly.</p>

<p>"You must bear it, Ley; even as she bears it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tell me what it is," he broke in, hoarsely. "Give me something
tangible to grapple with, and&mdash;well, then talk to me of
bearing it!"</p>

<p>"I cannot&mdash;she cannot," she replied, earnestly, solemnly.
"Even to me, heart to heart, she could not open her lips. Ley!
Fate is against you&mdash;you and her. There is no hope, no hope! I
feel it; I who would not have believed it, did not believe it even
from you! There is no hope, Ley!"</p>

<p>He let her sink into a chair and stood beside her, a look on his
face that was not good to see.</p>

<p>"Is there not?" he said, in a low voice. "You have appealed
to her. There is still one other to appeal to; I shall seek him."</p>

<p>She looked up, not with alarm but with solemn conviction.</p>

<p>"Do not," she said, "unless you wish to add to her sorrow!
No, Ley, if you strike at him, the blow must reach her."</p>

<p>"She told you that?"</p>

<p>"Yes; by word, by look. No, Ley, there is no hope there.
You cannot reach him except through her, and you will spare
her that. 'Tell him,' she said, 'that any effort he makes will
add to my misery. Tell him that I pray we may never meet
again.'" She paused a moment. "Ley, I know no more of the
cause than you, but I know this, that she is right."</p>

<p>He stood looking down at her, his face working, then at last
he answered:</p>

<p>"You are a brave girl, Lil," he said. "You must go now;
even you cannot help me to bear this. 'Pray that we may never
meet again,' and this was to have been our marriage day!"</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV">CHAPTER XXXIV.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> carefully avoided describing Lord Leycester Wyndward
as a "good" man. If to be generous, single-minded, impatient
of wrong and pitiful of the wronged; if to be blessed,
cursed with the capacity for loving madly and passionately; if
to be without fear, either moral or physical, be heroic, then he
was a hero; but I am afraid it cannot be said that he was
"good."</p>

<p>Before many weeks had elapsed since his parting with Stella,
the world had decided that he was indeed very bad. It is
scarcely too much to say that his name was the red rag which
was flourished in the eyes of those righteous, indignant bulls
whose mission in life it is to talk over their fellow-creatures' ill
deeds and worry them.</p>

<p>One mad exploit after another was connected with his name,
and it soon came to pass that no desperate thing was done within
the circle of the higher class, but he was credited with being
the ringleader, or at least with having a hand in it.</p>

<p>It was said that at that select and notorious club, "The Rookery,"
Lord Leycester was the most desperate of gamblers and
persistent of losers. Rumor went so far as to declare that even
the Wyndward estates could not stand the inroads which his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
losses at the gaming table were making. It was rumored, and
not contradicted, that he had "plunged" on the turf, and that
his stud was one of the largest and most expensive in England.</p>

<p>The society papers were full of insinuating paragraphs hinting
at the wildness of his career, and prophesying its speedy and
disastrous termination. He was compared with the lost characters
of past generations&mdash;likened to Lord Norbury, the Marquis
of Waterford, and similar dissipated individuals. His handsome
face and tall, thin, but still stalwart figure, had become famous,
and people nudged each other and pointed him out when he
passed along the fashionably-frequented thoroughfares.</p>

<p>His rare appearance in the haunts of society occasioned the
deepest interest and curiosity.</p>

<p>One enterprising photographer had managed, by the exercise
of vast ingenuity, to procure his likeness, and displayed copies
in his window; but they were speedily and promptly withdrawn.</p>

<p>There was no reckless hardihood with which he was not
credited. Men were proud of possessing a horse that he had
ridden, because their capability of riding it proved their courage.</p>

<p>Scandal seized upon his name and made a hearty and never-ending
meal of it; and yet, by some strange phenomenal chance,
no one heard it connected with that of a woman.</p>

<p>Some said that he drank hard, rode hard, and played hard,
and that he was fast rushing headlong to ruin, but no one ever
hinted that he was dragging a member of the fair sex with him.</p>

<p>He was seen occasionally in drags bound to Richmond, or at
Bohemian parties in St. John's Wood, but no woman could boast
that he was her special conquest.</p>

<p>It was even said that he had suddenly acquired a distinct distaste
for female society, and that he had been heard to declare
that, but for the women, the world would still be worth living
in.</p>

<p>It was very sad; society was shocked as well as curious, dismayed
as well as intensely interested. Mothers with marriageable
daughters openly declared that something ought to be done,
that it was impossible that such a man, the heir to such a title
and estates should be allowed to throw himself away. The
deepest pity was expressed for Lady Wyndward, and one or two
of the aforesaid mammas had ventured, with some tremors, to
mention his case to that august lady. But they got little for
their pains, save a calm, dignified, and haughty rebuff. Never,
by word, look, or sign did the countess display the sorrow which
was imbittering her life.</p>

<p>The stories of his ill-doings could not fail to reach her ears,
seeing that they were common talk, but she never flushed or
even winced. She knew when she entered a crowded room, and
a sudden silence fell, to be followed by a spasmodic attempt at
conversation, that those assembled were speaking of her son, but
by no look or word did she confess to that knowledge.</p>

<p>Only in the secrecy of her own chamber did she let loose the
floodgates of her sorrow and admit her despair. The time had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
come when she felt almost tempted to regret that he had not
married "the little girl&mdash;-the painter's niece," and settled down in
his own way.</p>

<p>She knew that it was broken off; she knew, or divined that
some plot had brought about the separation, but she had asked
no questions, not even of Lenore, who was now her constant companion
and chosen friend.</p>

<p>Between them Leycester's name was rarely mentioned. Not
even from her husband would she hear aught of accusation against
the boy who had ever been the one darling of her life.</p>

<p>Once old Lady Longford had pronounced his name, had spoken
a couple of words or so, but even she could not get the mother
to unburden her heart.</p>

<p>"What is to be done?" the old lady had asked, one morning
when the papers had appeared with an account of a mad exploit
in which the well-known initials Lord Y&mdash;&mdash; W&mdash;&mdash; had clearly
indicated his complicity.</p>

<p>"I do not know," she had replied. "I do not think there is anything
to be done."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that he is to be allowed to go on like this, to
drift to ruin without a hand to stay him?" demanded the old
lady almost wrathfully; and the countess had turned on her
angrily.</p>

<p>"Who can do anything to stay him? Have you yourself not
said that it is impossible, that he must be left alone?"</p>

<p>"I did, yes, I did," admitted the old countess, "but things were
not so bad then, not nearly. All this is different. There is a
woman in the case, Ethel!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the countess, bitterly, "there is," and she felt tempted
to echo the assertion which Leycester had been reputed to utter,
"that if there had been no women the world would have been
worth living in."</p>

<p>Then Lady Longford had attempted to "get at" Leycester
through his companion Lord Charles, but Lord Charles had plainly
intimated his helplessness.</p>

<p>"Going wrong," he said, shaking his head. "If Leycester's going
wrong, so am I, because, don't you see, I'm bound to go with him.
Always did, you know, and can't leave him now; too late in the
day."</p>

<p>"And so you'll let your bosom friend go to the dogs"&mdash;the old
lady had almost used a stronger word&mdash;"rather than say a word
to stop him?"</p>

<p>"Say a word!" retorted Lord Charles, ruefully. "I've said
twenty. Only yesterday I told him the pace couldn't last; but he
only laughed and told me that was his business, and that it would
last long enough for him."</p>

<p>"Lord Charles, you are a fool!" exclaimed the old lady.</p>

<p>And Lord Charles had shook his head.</p>

<p>"I daresay I am," he said, not a whit offended. "I always was
where Leycester was concerned."</p>

<p>The one creature in the world&mdash;excepting Stella&mdash;who could
have influenced him, knew nothing of what was going on.</p>

<p>The excitement of her visit to Stella, and her terrible interview<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
during it, had utterly prostrated the delicate girl, and Lilian lay
in her room in the mansion in Grosvenor Square, looking more
like the flower namesake than ever.</p>

<p>The doctor had insisted that no excitement of any kind was
to be permitted to approach her, and they had kept the rumors
and stories of Leycester's doings from her knowledge.</p>

<p>He came to see her sometimes, and even in the darkened room
she could see the ravages which the last few months had made
with him; but he was always gentle and considerate toward
her, and in response to her loving inquiries always declared that
he was well&mdash;quite well. Stella's name, by mutual consent,
was never mentioned between them. It was understood that
that page of his life was closed for ever; but after every visit,
when he had left her, she lay and wept over the knowledge that
he had not forgotten her. She could see it in his eyes, hear it
in his voice. As Stella had said, Leycester was not one to love
and unlove in a day&mdash;in a week&mdash;in a month!</p>

<p>So the Summer had crept on to the Autumn. Not one word
has he heard of Stella. Though she was in his thoughts day and
night, alike in the hour of the wildest dissipation, and in the
silent watches of the night, he had heard no word of her. All
his efforts were directed towards forgetting her. And yet if he
picked up a paper or a book and chanced to come upon her
name&mdash;Stella!&mdash;a pang shot through his heart, and the blood
fled from his face.</p>

<p>The Autumn had come, and London was almost deserted, but
there were some who clung on still. There are some to whom
the shady side of Pall Mall and their clubs are the only Paradise;
and the card-rooms of the Rookery are by no means empty.</p>

<p>In the middle of September, when half "the town" was in
the country popping at the birds, Leycester and Lord Charles
were still haunting Pall Mall.</p>

<p>"Better go down and look at the birds," said Lord Charles one
night, morning rather, for it was in the small hours. "What
do you say to running down to my place, Ley?"</p>

<p>"My place" was Vernon Grange, a noble Elizabethan mansion,
standing right in the center of one of the finest shooting
districts. The grange was at present shut up, the birds running
wild, the keepers in despair, all because Lord Leycester could
not forget Stella, and his friend would not desert him!</p>

<p>"Suppose we start to-morrow morning," went on Lord Charles,
struggling into his light over-coat and yawning. "We can take
some fellows down!&mdash;plenty of birds, you know. Had a letter
from the head keeper yesterday; fellow quite broken-hearted,
give you my word! Come on, Ley! I'm sick of this, I am, indeed.
I hate the place," and he glanced sleepily at the dimly
lit hall of the Rookery. "What's the use of playing ecarte and
baccarat night after night; it doesn't amuse you even if you
win!"</p>

<p>Leycester was striding on, scarcely appearing to hear, but the
word "amuse" roused him.</p>

<p>"Nothing 'amuses,' Charles," he said, quietly. "Nothing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
Everything is a bore. The only thing is to forget, and the cards
help me to do that, for a little while, at least&mdash;a little while."</p>

<p>Lord Charles nearly groaned.</p>

<p>"They'll make you forget you've anything to lose shortly," he
said. "We've been going it like the very deuce, lately, Ley!"</p>

<p>Leycester stopped and looked at him, wearily, absently.</p>

<p>"I suppose we have, Charles," he said; "why don't you cut
it? I don't mind it; it is a matter of indifference to me. But
you! you can cut it. You shall go down to-morrow morning,
and I'll stay."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said the constant friend. "I'm in the same boat,
Ley, and I'll pull while you do. When you are tired of this
foolery, we'll come to shore and be sensible human beings again.
I shan't leave the boat till you do."</p>

<p>"You'll wait till it goes down?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose I shall," was the quiet response, "if down it
must go."</p>

<p>Leycester walked on in silence for a minute.</p>

<p>"What a mockery it all is!" he said, with a half smile.</p>

<p>"Yes," assented Lord Charles, slowly; "some people would
call it by a stronger name, I suppose. I don't see the use of it.
The use&mdash;why it's the very ruination. Ley, you are killing yourself."</p>

<p>"And you."</p>

<p>"No," said Lord Charles, coolly, "I'm all right&mdash;I've got nothing
on my mind. I'm bored and used-up while it lasts, but
when it's over I can turn in and get to sleep. You can't&mdash;or you
don't."</p>

<p>Leycester thrust his hands in his pockets in silence, he could
not deny it.</p>

<p>"I don't believe you sleep one night out of three," said Lord
Charles. "You've got the mad fever, Ley. I wish it could be
altered."</p>

<p>Leycester walked on still more quickly.</p>

<p>"You shall go down to-morrow, Charles," he said. "I don't
think I'll come."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>Leycester stopped and put his hand on his arm, and looked at
him with a feverish smile on his face.</p>

<p>"Simply because I cannot&mdash;I cannot. I hate the sight of a
green field. I hate the country. Heaven! go down there!
Charlie, you know dogs can't bear the sight of water when they
are queer. You've got a river down there, haven't you? Well,
the sight of that river, the sound of that stream, would drive
me mad! I cannot go, but you shall."</p>

<p>Lord Charles shook his head.</p>

<p>"Very well. Where now! Let us go home."</p>

<p>Leycester stopped short.</p>

<p>"Good-night," he said. "Go home. Don't be foolish, Charlie&mdash;go
home."</p>

<p>"And you!"</p>

<p>Leycester put his hand on his arm slowly, and looked round.</p>

<p>"Not home," he said&mdash;"not yet. I'm wakeful to-night."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>And he smiled grimly.</p>

<p>"The thought of the meadow and the river has set me thinking.
I'll go back to the 'Rookery.'"</p>

<p>Lord Charles turned without a word, and they went back.</p>

<p>The tables were still occupied, and the entrance of the two
men was noticed and greeted with a word here and there. Lord
Charles dropped on to a chair and called for some coffee&mdash;a great
deal of coffee was drank at the "Rookery"&mdash;but Leycester wandered
about from table to table.</p>

<p>Presently he paused beside some men who were playing baccarat.</p>

<p>They had been playing since midnight, and piles of notes, and
gold, and I O U's told pretty plainly of the size of the stakes.</p>

<p>Leycester stood leaning on the back of a chair, absently watching
the play, but his thoughts were wandering back to the
meadows of Wyndward, and he stood once more beside the weir
stream, with the lovely face upon his breast.</p>

<p>But suddenly a movement of one of the players opposite him
attracted his attention, and he came back to the present with a
start.</p>

<p>A young fellow&mdash;a mere boy&mdash;the heir to a marquisate, Lord
Bellamy&mdash;the reader will not have forgotten him&mdash;had dropped
suddenly across the table, his outstretched hands still clutching
the cards. There was an instant stir, the men started to their
feet, the servants crowded up; all stood aghast.</p>

<p>Leycester was the first to recover presence of mind, and,
hurrying round the table, picked the boy up in his strong arms.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Bell?" he said; then, as he glanced at the
white face, with the dark lines round the eyes, he said in his
quiet, composed voice: "He has fainted; fetch a doctor, some of
you."</p>

<p>And lifting him easily in his arms, he carried him in to an adjoining
room.</p>

<p>Lord Charles followed with a glass of water, but Leycester put
it aside with the one word&mdash;</p>

<p>"Brandy."</p>

<p>Lord Charles brought some brandy and closed the door, the
others standing outside aghast and frightened. Leycester poured
some of the spirit through his closed teeth, and the boy came
back to life&mdash;to what was left for him of life&mdash;and smiled up at
him.</p>

<p>"The room was hot, Bell," said Leycester, in his gentle way;
he could be gentle even now. "I wanted you to go home two&mdash;three&mdash;hours
ago! Why didn't you go?"</p>

<p>"You&mdash;stayed&mdash;&mdash;" gasped the boy.</p>

<p>Leicester's lips twitched.</p>

<p>"I!" he said. "That is a different matter."</p>

<p>The boy's head drooped, and fell back on Leycester's arm.</p>

<p>"Tell them not to stop the game," he said; "let somebody
play for me!" then he went off again.</p>

<p>The doctor came, a fashionable, hardworked man, a friend
both of Leycester's and Guildford's, and bent over the lad as he
lay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's a faint," said Lord Charles, nervously; "nothing else, eh,
doctor?"</p>

<p>The doctor looked up.</p>

<p>"My brougham is outside," he said. "I will take him home."</p>

<p>Leycester nodded, and carried the slight frame through the
hall and placed it in the brougham. The doctor followed. The
cool air revived the boy, and he made an effort to sit up, looking
round as if in search of something; at last his wandering sight
fell on Leycester's, and he smiled.</p>

<p>"That's right, Bell!" said Leycester; "you will be well to-morrow;
but mind, no more of this!" and he took the small
white hand.</p>

<p>The heir to a marquisate clung to the hand, and smiled again.</p>

<p>"No, there will be no more of it, Leycester," he breathed,
painfully. "There will be no more of anything for me; I have
seen the last of the Rookery&mdash;and of you all. Leycester, I am
dying!"</p>

<p>Leycester forced a smile to his white face.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Bell," he said.</p>

<p>The boy raised a weak, trembling finger, and pointed to the
doctor's face.</p>

<p>"Look at him," he said. "He never told a lie in his&mdash;life.
Ask him."</p>

<p>"Tell them to drive on, my lord," said the doctor.</p>

<p>The boy laughed, an awful laugh; then his face changed, and
even as the brougham moved on, he clung to Leycester's hand,
and bending forward, panted:</p>

<p>"Leycester&mdash;good-bye!"</p>

<p>Leycester stood, white and motionless as a statue, for the space
of a minute; then he turned to Lord Charles, who stood biting
his pale lips and looking after the brougham.</p>

<p>"I will go with you to-morrow," he said, hoarsely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Time</span>&mdash;which Lord Leycester had been so recklessly wasting in
"riotous living"&mdash;passed very quiet indeed in the Thames valley,
beneath the white walls of Wyndward Hall.</p>

<p>During the months which elapsed since that fearful parting
between the two lovers, life had gone on at the cottage just as
before, with the one great exception that Jasper Adelstone had
become almost a daily visitor, and that Stella was engaged to
him.</p>

<p>That was all the difference, but what a difference it was!</p>

<p>Lord Leycester gone&mdash;her tried, her first lover, the man who
had won her maiden heart&mdash;and in his place this man whom she&mdash;hated.</p>

<p>But yet she fought the battle womanfully. She had made a
bargain&mdash;she had sacrificed herself for her two loved ones, had
given herself freely and unreservedly, and she strove to carry
out her part of the compact.</p>

<p>She looked a little pale, a little graver than of old, but
there was no querulous tone of complaint about her; if she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
did not laugh the frank, light-hearted laugh that her uncle
used to declare was like the "voice of sunlight," she smiled
sometimes; and if the smile was rather sad than mirthful, it
was very sweet.</p>

<p>The old man noticed nothing amiss; he thought she had
grown quieter, but set the change down to her betrothal; he
went on painting, absorbed in his work, scarcely heeding the
world that ran by him so merrily, so sadly, and was quite
content. Jasper's quiet, low-toned voice did not disturb him,
and he would go on painting while they were talking near
him, dead to their presence. Since that last blow his boy's
crime had struck him, he had lived more entirely and completely
in his art than ever.</p>

<p>Of the two, Frank and Stella, perhaps it was Frank who
seemed the most changed. He had grown thinner and paler,
and more girlish and delicate-looking than ever.</p>

<p>It had been arranged that he should go up to the university
for the next term, but Mr. Hamilton, the old doctor, who
had been called in to see to a slight cough which the boy had
started, had hummed and hawed, and advised that the 'varsity
should be shelved for the present.</p>

<p>"Was he ill?" Stella had asked, anxiously&mdash;very anxiously,
for, woman-like, she had grown to love with a passionate devotion
the boy for whom she had sacrificed herself.</p>

<p>"N&mdash;o; not ill," the old doctor had said. "Certainly not
ill," and he went on to explain that Frank was delicate&mdash;that
all boys with fair hair and fair complexions were more or
less delicate.</p>

<p>"But he has such a beautiful color," said Stella, nervously.</p>

<p>"Y&mdash;es; a nice color," said the old man, and that was all
she could get out of him.</p>

<p>But the cough did not go; and as the Autumn mists stole up
from the river and covered the meadows with a filmy veil, beautiful
to behold, the cough got worse; but the beautiful color did
not go either, and so Stella was not very anxious.</p>

<p>As for Frank himself, he treated his ailments with supreme
indifference.</p>

<p>"Do I take any medicine?" he said, in answer to Stella's
questioning. "Yes, I take all the old woman&mdash;I beg his pardon!&mdash;the
doctor sends. It isn't very unpleasant, and though it doesn't
do me much good apparently, it seems to afford you and the
aforesaid old woman some satisfaction, and so we are pleased all
round."</p>

<p>"You don't seem to take any interest in things, Frank," said
Stella, one morning, when she had come into the garden to look
at the trees that drew a long line of gold and brown and yellow
along the river bank, and had found him leaning on the gate,
his hands clasped before him, his eyes fixed on the Hall, very
much as she had first seen him, the night he had come home.</p>

<p>He looked round at her and smiled faintly.</p>

<p>"Why don't you go and try the fish?" she said. "Or&mdash;or&mdash;go
for a ride? You only wander about the gardens or in the
meadows."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>He looked at her curiously.</p>

<p>"Why do not you?" he said, slowly, his large blue eyes fixed
on her face, which grew slowly blush-red under his regard. "You
do not seem to take much interest in things, Stel. You don't go
and fish, or&mdash;or&mdash;take a drive, or anything. You only wander
about the garden, or in the meadows."</p>

<p>The long lashes swept her cheeks, and she struggled with a
sigh. His words had told home.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but," she said falteringly, "I am not a boy. Girls
should stay at home and attend to their duties."</p>

<p>"And walk and move as if they were in a dream&mdash;as if their
hearts and souls were divorced from their bodies&mdash;and miles,
miles away," he said, waving his thin white hand in the air slowly.</p>

<p>Her lips quivered, and she turned her face away, but only for
a moment; it was back upon him with a smile again.</p>

<p>"You are a foolish, fanciful boy!" she said, putting her hand
on his shoulder and caressing his cheek.</p>

<p>"Perhaps so," he said. "'My fancies are more than all the
world to me,' says the poet, you know," he added, bitterly.</p>

<p>Stella's heart ached.</p>

<p>"Are you angry with me, Frank?" she said. "Don't be!"</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"No, not angry," he said, looking out at the mist that was rising.</p>

<p>She smothered a sigh; she understood his reproach; not a
moment of the day but he accused her in his heart of betraying
Lord Leycester; if he could but have known why she had done
it; but that he never would know!</p>

<p>"You are a fanciful boy," she said, with a forced lightness.
"What are you dreaming about now, I wonder?"</p>

<p>"I was wondering too," he answered, without looking at her,
"I was wondering&mdash;shall I tell you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She answered "yes," with her hand against his cheek.</p>

<p>"I was wondering where Lord Leycester was, and how&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her hand dropped to her side and pressed her heart; the
sudden mention of the name had struck her like a blow.</p>

<p>He glanced round.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," he said, "I forgot; his name was never
to be mentioned, was it? I will not sin again&mdash;in word. In
thought&mdash;one can't help one's thoughts, Stel!"</p>

<p>"No," she murmured, almost inaudibly.</p>

<p>"Thoughts are free," he said; "mine are not, however; they
are always flying after him&mdash;after him, the best and noblest of
men, the man who saved my life. You see, though I may not
speak of him, it would be ungrateful to forget him!"</p>

<p>"Frank!"</p>

<p>At her tone of piteous supplication and almost reproach, he
turned and put his hand on her arm.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Stel! I didn't mean to hurt you, but&mdash;but&mdash;well
it is so hard to understand, so hard to bear! To feel, to
know that he is far away and suffering, while that man, Jasper
Adelstone&mdash;I beg your pardon, Stel! There! I will say no
more!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do not," she murmured, her face white and strained, but
resigned&mdash;"do not. Besides, you are wrong; he has forgotten
by this time."</p>

<p>He turned and looked at her with a sudden anger; then he
smiled as the exquisite beauty of her face smote him.</p>

<p>"You wrong him and yourself. No, Stel, men do not forget
such a girl as you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No more!" she said, almost in a tone of command.</p>

<p>He shook his head, and the cough came on and silenced him.</p>

<p>She put her arm round his neck.</p>

<p>"That cough," she said. "You must go in, dear! Look at
the mist. Come, come in!"</p>

<p>He turned in silence and walked beside her for a few steps.
Then he said tremulously:</p>

<p>"Stella, let me ask one question, and then I will be silent&mdash;for
always."</p>

<p>"Well?" she said.</p>

<p>"Have you heard from him?&mdash;do you know where he is?"</p>

<p>She paused a moment to control her voice, then she said:</p>

<p>"I have heard no word; I do not know whether he is alive or
dead."</p>

<p>He sighed and his head dropped upon his breast.</p>

<p>"Let us go in," he said, then he started, for his ears, particularly
sharp, had caught the sound of a well-known footstep.</p>

<p>"There is&mdash;Jasper," he said, with a pause before the name,
and he drew his arm away and walked away from her. Stella
turned with a strange set smile on her face, the set smile which
she had learnt to greet him with.</p>

<p>He came up the path with his quick and peculiar suppressed
step, his hand outstretched. He would have taken her in his
arms and kissed her&mdash;if he had dared. But he could not. With
all his determination and resolution he dared not. There was
something, some mysterious halo about his victim which kept
him almost at arm's length; it was as if she had surrounded
herself by a magic circle which he could not pass.</p>

<p>He took her hand and raised it to his lips and kissed it, his
eyes drinking in her beauty and grace with a thirsty wistfulness.</p>

<p>"My darling," he murmured, in his soft, low voice, "out so
late. Will you not catch cold?"</p>

<p>"No," she said, and like her smile her voice seemed set and
tutored. "I shall not catch cold, I never do under any circumstance.
But I have just sent Frank in, he has been coughing
terribly&mdash;he does not seem at all strong."</p>

<p>He frowned with swift impatience.</p>

<p>"Frank is all right," he said, and there was a touch of jealousy
in his voice. "Are you not unduly anxious about the boy&mdash;you
alarm yourself without cause."</p>

<p>"Alarm myself," she repeated, ready to be alarmed at the
suggestion. "I&mdash;don't think, I hope I am not alarmed. Why
should I be?" she said, anxiously.</p>

<p>The jealousy grew more pronounced.</p>

<p>"There is no reason whatever," he said, shortly. "The boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
is all right. He has been getting his feet wet and caught cold,
that is all."</p>

<p>Stella smiled.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is all," she said, "of course. But it is strange Dr.
Hamilton doesn't get rid of it for him."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he doesn't help the doctor," he retorted. "Boys
always are careless about themselves. But don't let Frank
absorb all the conversation," he said. "Let us talk of ourselves,"
and he kissed her hand again.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Stella, obediently.</p>

<p>He kept her hand in his and pressed it.</p>

<p>"I have come to speak to you to-night, Stella, about ourselves,
darling. I want you to be very good to me!"</p>

<p>She looked forward at the lighted room with the same set expression,
waiting patiently, obediently, for him to proceed.
There was no response in her touch or in her face. He noticed
it&mdash;he never failed to notice it, and it maddened him. He set
his teeth hard.</p>

<p>"Stella, I have been waiting month after month to say what I
am going to say now; but I couldn't wait any longer, my
darling, my own, I wish the marriage to take place."</p>

<p>She did not start, but she turned and looked at him, and her
face shone whitely in the darkness, and he felt a faint shudder
in the hand imprisoned in his.</p>

<p>"Will you not speak?" he said, after a moment, almost angry,
because of the tempest of passion and breathed tenderness that
possessed him. "Have you nothing to say, or will you say 'no?'
I almost expect it."</p>

<p>"I will not say no," she said, at last, and her voice was cold
and strained. "You have a right&mdash;the right I have given you&mdash;to
demand the fulfillment of our bargain."</p>

<p>"Good Heaven!" he broke in, passionately. "Why do you
talk like this? Shall I never, never win you to love me? Will
you never forget how we came together?"</p>

<p>"Do not ask me," she said, almost pleaded, and her face quivered.
"Indeed&mdash;indeed, I try, try&mdash;try hard to forget the past,
and to please you!"</p>

<p>It was piteous to hear and see her, and his heart ached; but it
was for himself as well as for her.</p>

<p>"Do you doubt my love?" he said, hoarsely. "Do you think
any man could love you better than I do? Does that count as
nothing with you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," she said, slowly, sadly. "It does count. I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"
then she looked down. "Why will you speak of love between
us?" she said. "Ask me&mdash;tell me to do anything, and I will do
it, but do not speak of love!"</p>

<p>He bit his lip.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, with an effort, "I will not. I see I cannot
touch your heart yet. But the time will come. You cannot
stand against a love like mine. And you will let our marriage
be soon?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, simply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>He raised her hand to his lips, and kissed it, hungrily, and she
forced back the shudder which threatened to overmaster her.</p>

<p>"By soon," he murmured, as they walked toward the house,
"I mean quite soon&mdash;before the winter."</p>

<p>Stella did not speak.</p>

<p>"Let it be next month, darling," he murmured. "I shall not
feel sure of you until you are my very own. Once you are mine
beyond question, I will teach you to love me."</p>

<p>Stella looked at him, and a strange, despairing smile, more
bitter and sad than tears, shone on her pale lips. Teach her to
love him! As if love could be taught!</p>

<p>"I am not afraid," he said, answering her smile; "no one
could withstand it&mdash;not even you, though your heart were adamant."</p>

<p>"It is not that," she said, in a low voice, as she thought of the
dull aching which was its pittance by day and night.</p>

<p>They went into the house. Mr. Etheridge was wandering
about the room, smoking his pipe, his head upon his breast,
buried in thought, as usual. Frank was lying back in the old
arm-chair; he looked wearily-fragile and delicate, but the beautiful
color shone in his face.</p>

<p>He looked up and nodded as Jasper entered, but Jasper was
not satisfied with the nod, and went over to him and laid a hand
upon his shoulder, at which the boy winced and shrank faintly;
he never could bear Jasper to touch him, and always resented it.</p>

<p>"Well, Frank," he said, with his faint smile, "how's the cold
to-night?"</p>

<p>Frank murmured something indistinctly, and shifted in his
seat.</p>

<p>"Not so well, eh?" said Jasper. "It seems to me that a
change would do you good. What do you say to going away for
a little while?"</p>

<p>The boy looked up at Stella with a glance of alarm. Leave
Stella!</p>

<p>"I don't want to go away," he said, shortly. "I am quite
well. I hate a change."</p>

<p>Stella came up to his chair, and knelt beside him.</p>

<p>"It would do you good, dear," she said, in her low, musical
voice.</p>

<p>He bent near her.</p>

<p>"Do you mean&mdash;alone?" he asked. "I don't want to go alone&mdash;I
won't, in fact."</p>

<p>"No, not alone, certainly," said Jasper, with his smile. "I
think some one else wants a change too."</p>

<p>And he looked at Stella tenderly.</p>

<p>"I'll go if Stella goes," said Frank, curtly.</p>

<p>"What do you say, sir?" said Jasper to the old man.</p>

<p>He stared, and the proposal had to be put to him <i>in extenso</i>;
he had not heard a word of what had been said.</p>

<p>"Go away! yes, if you like. But why? Frank's cold? I
don't suppose any other place is better for a cold is it? It is?
Very well then. You don't want me to come, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;&mdash;" said Jasper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>"I couldn't do it!" exclaimed the old man, almost with
alarm. "I should be like a fish out of water. I couldn't paint
away from the river and the meadows. Oh, it's impossible!
Besides, you don't want an old man pottering about," and he
looked at Stella and smiled grimly.</p>

<p>"I couldn't go without you," said Stella, quietly.</p>

<p>"Nonsense," he said; "there's the other old woman, Mrs.
Penfold, take her; she can go. It will do her good, though she
hasn't a cold."</p>

<p>Then he stopped in front of the boy and looked at him, with
the strange reserved, almost sad, expression which always came
upon his race when he regarded him.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, in a low voice; "he wants a change. I
haven't noticed; he looks thin and unwell. Yes, you had better
go! Where will you go?"</p>

<p>Stella shook her head with a smile, but Jasper was ready.</p>

<p>"Let me see," he said, thoughtfully. "We don't want a cold
place, the change would be too great; and we don't want too hot
a place. What do you say to Cornwall?"</p>

<p>The old man nodded.</p>

<p>Stella smiled again.</p>

<p>"I haven't anything to say," she said. "Would you like
Cornwall, Frank?"</p>

<p>He looked from one to the other.</p>

<p>"What made you think of Cornwall?" he asked Jasper, suspiciously.</p>

<p>Jasper laughed softly.</p>

<p>"It seemed to me just the place to suit you. It is mild and
clear, and just what you want. Besides, I remember a little
place near the sea, a sheltered village in a bay&mdash;Carlyon they
call it&mdash;that would just do for us. What do you say? Let me
see, where is the map?"</p>

<p>He went and got a map and spreading it out on the table,
called to Stella.</p>

<p>"This is it," he said, then in a low voice he whispered:
"There is a pretty, secluded little church there, Stella. Why
should we not be married there?"</p>

<p>She started, and her hand fell on the map.</p>

<p>"I am thinking of you, my darling," he said. "For my part
I should like to be married here&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, not here," she faltered, as she thought of standing before
the altar in the Wyndward Church and seeing the white walls
of the Hall as she uttered her marriage vow. "Not here."</p>

<p>"I understand," he said. "Then why not there? Your
uncle could come down for that, I think."</p>

<p>She did not speak, and with a smile of satisfaction he folded
the map.</p>

<p>"It is all settled," he said. "We go to Carlyon. You will
come down for a little while, I hope, sir. We shall want you."</p>

<p>The old man pushed the white hair off his forehead.</p>

<p>"Eh?" he asked. "What for?"</p>

<p>"To give Stella away," replied Jasper. "She has promised to
marry me there."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>The old man looked at her.</p>

<p>"Why not here?" he asked, naturally, but Stella shook her
head.</p>

<p>"Very well," he said. "It is a strange fancy, but girls are
fanciful. Off you go, then, and don't make more fuss than you
can help."</p>

<p>So Stella's fate was settled, and the day, the fatal day, loomed
darkly before her.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXXVI">CHAPTER XXXVI.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Lord Charles</span> was too glad to gain Leycester's consent to
leave town to care where they went, and to prevent all chance
of Leycester's changing his mind, this stanch and constant
friend went with him to his rooms and interviewed the patient
Oliver.</p>

<p>"Go away, sir?" said that faithful and long-suffering individual.
"I'm glad of it! His lordship&mdash;and you too, begging
your pardon, my lord&mdash;ought to have gone long ago. It's been
terrible hot work these last few weeks. I never knew his lordship
so wild. And where are we going, my lord?"</p>

<p>That was the question. Leycester rendered no assistance
whatever, beyond declaring that he would not go where there
was a houseful of people. He had thrown himself into a chair,
and sat moodily regarding the floor. Bellamy's sudden illness
and prophetic words had given him a shock. He was quite
ready to go anywhere, so that it was away from London,
which had become hateful to him since the last hour.</p>

<p>Lord Charles lit a pipe, and Oliver mixed a soda-and-brandy
for him, and they two talked it over in an undertone.</p>

<p>"I've got a little place in the Doone Valley, Devonshire, you
know," said Lord Charles, talking to Oliver quite confidentially.
"It's a mere box&mdash;just enough for ourselves, and we should
have to rough it, rough it awfully. But there's plenty of game,
and some fishing, and it's as wild as a March hare!"</p>

<p>"That's just what his lordship wants," said Oliver. "I know
him so well, you see, my lord. I must say that I've taken the
way we've been going on lately very serious; it isn't the money,
that don't matter, my lord; and it isn't altogether the wildness,
we've been wild before, my lord, you know."</p>

<p>Lord Charles grunted.</p>

<p>"But that was only in play like, and there is no harm in it;
but this sort of thing that's being going on hasn't been play, and
it ain't amused his lordship a bit; why he's more down than
when we came up."</p>

<p>"That's so, Oliver," assented Lord Charles, gloomily.</p>

<p>"I don't know what it was, and it isn't for me to be curious,
my lord," continued the faithful fellow, "but it's my opinion
that something went wrong down at the Hall, and that his lordship
cut up rough about it."</p>

<p>Lord Charles, remembering that letter and the beautiful girl
at the cottage, nodded.</p>

<p>"Perhaps so," he said. "Well, we'll go down to the Doone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
Valley. Better pack up to-night, or rather this morning. I'll
go home and get a bath, and we'll be off at once. Fish out the
train, will you?"</p>

<p>Oliver, who was a perfect master of "Bradshaw," turned
over the leaves of that valuable compilation, and discovered a
train that left in the afternoon, and Lord Charles "broke it" to
Leycester.</p>

<p>Leycester accepted their decision with perfect indifference.</p>

<p>"I shall be ready," he said, in a dispassionate, indifferent
way. "Tell Oliver what you want."</p>

<p>"It's a mere box in a jungle," said Lord Charles.</p>

<p>"A jungle is what I want," said Leycester, grimly.</p>

<p>With the same grim indifference he started by that afternoon
train, smoking in silence nearly all the way down to Barnstaple,
and showing no interest in anything.</p>

<p>Oliver had telegraphed to secure seats in the coach that leaves
that ancient town for the nearest point to the Valley, and early
the next morning they arrived.</p>

<p>A couple of horses and a dogcart had been sent on&mdash;how
Oliver managed to get them off was a mystery, but his command
of resources at most times amounted to the magical&mdash;and
they drove from Teignmouth to the Valley, and reached the
"Hut," as it was called.</p>

<p>It was in very truth a mere box, but it was a box set in the
center of a sportsman's paradise. Lonely and solitary it stood
on the edge of the deer forest, within sound of a babbling trout-stream,
and in the center of the best shooting in Devonshire.</p>

<p>Oliver, with the aforesaid magic, procured a couple of servants,
and soon got the little place in order; and here the two
friends lived, like hermits in a dell.</p>

<p>They fished and shot and rode all day, returning at night to a
plain, late dinner; and altogether led a life so different to that
which they had been leading as it was possible to imagine.</p>

<p>Lord Charles enjoyed it. He got brown, and as fit and "as
hard as nails," as he described it, but Leycester took things differently.
The gloom which had settled upon him would not be
dispelled by the mountain air and the beauty of the exquisite
valley.</p>

<p>Always and ever there seemed some cloud hanging over him,
spoiling his enjoyment and witching the charm from his efforts
at amusement. While Charles was killing trout in the stream,
or dropping the pheasants in the moors, Leycester would wander
up and down the valley, gun or rod in hand, using neither, his
head drooping, his eyes fixed in gloomy retrospection.</p>

<p>In simple truth he was haunted by a spirit which clung to him
now as it had clung to him in those days of feverish gayety and
dissipation.</p>

<p>The vision of the slim, beautiful girl whom he loved was ever
before him, her face floated between him and the mountains, her
voice mingled with the stream. He saw her by day, he dreamed
of her by night. Sometimes he would wake with a start, and
fancy that she was still his own, and that they were standing
by the weir, her hand in his, her voice whispering, "Leycester,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
I love you!" Distance only lent enchantment to her beauty and
her grace. In a word, he could not forget her!</p>

<p>Sometimes he wondered whether he had been right in yielding
her up to Jasper Adelstone so quietly; but as he recalled that
morning, and Stella's face and words, he felt that he could not
have done otherwise. Yes, he had lost her, she had gone forever,
yet he could not forget her. It seemed very strange, even
to himself. After all, there were so many beautiful women he
could have chosen; some he had been almost in love with, and
yet he had forgotten them. What was there about Stella to
cling to him so persistently? He remembered every little unconscious
trick of voice and manner, the faint little smile that curved
her lip, the deep light in the dark eyes as they lifted to his,
asking, taking his love. There was a special little trick or mannerism
she had, a way of bending her head and looking at him
half over her shoulder, that simply haunted him; she came&mdash;the
vision of her&mdash;to the side of his chair and his bed, and looked at
him so, and he could see the graceful curve of the delicate neck.
Ah, me! ah, me! It was very weak and foolish, perhaps, that
a strong man of the world should be held in such thrall by a
simple girl, just a girl; but men are made so, and will so be held,
when they are strong and true, till the world ends.</p>

<p>It was very slow for Charlie&mdash;very slow and very rough, but
he was one of those rare friends who stick close in such a time.
He fished, and shot, and rode, and walked, and was always
cheerful and never obtrusive; but though he never made any remark,
he could not but notice that Leycester was in a bad way.
He was getting thinner and older looking, and the haggard lines,
which the wild town life had begun to draw, deepened.</p>

<p>Lord Charles was beginning to be afraid that the Doone Valley
also would fail.</p>

<p>"Ever hear anything of your people, Ley?" he asked one
night, as they sat in the living room of the hut. The night was
warm for the time of year, and they sat by the open window
smoking their pipes, and clad in their shooting suits of woolen
mixture.</p>

<p>Leycester was leaning back, his head resting on his hand, his
eyes fixed on the starlit sky, his long knickerbockered legs
outstretched.</p>

<p>"My people?" he replied, with a little movement as of one
waking from a dream. "No. I believe they are in the country
somewhere."</p>

<p>"Didn't leave any address for them?"</p>

<p>Leycester shook his head.</p>

<p>"No. I have no doubt they know it, however; Oliver is engaged
to Lilian's maid, Jeanette, and doubtless writes to her."</p>

<p>Charles looked at him.</p>

<p>"Getting tired of this, old man?" he asked, quietly.</p>

<p>"No," said Leycester. "Not at all. I can keep it up as long
as you like. If you are tired, we will go. Don't imagine that I
am insensible to the boredom you are undergoing, Charlie. But
I advised you to let me go my way alone, did I not?"</p>

<p>"That's so," was the cheerful response. "But I didn't choose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
did I? And I don't now. But all the same, I should like to see
you look a little more chippy, Ley."</p>

<p>Leycester looked up at him and smiled, grimly.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether you were ever in any trouble in your life,
Charlie," he said.</p>

<p>Lord Charles drained the glass of whisky and water that stood
beside him.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said; "but I'm like a duck, it pours off my back, and
there I am again."</p>

<p>"I wish I were like a duck!" said Leycester, with bitter self-scorn.
"Charlie, you have the misfortune to be tied to a haunted
man. I am haunted by the ghost of an old and lost happiness,
and I can't get rid of it."</p>

<p>Charlie looked at him and then away.</p>

<p>"I know," he said; "I haven't said anything, but I know.
Well, I am not surprised; she is a beautiful creature, and one of
the sort to stick in a man's mind. I'm very sorry, old man.
There isn't any chance of its coming right?"</p>

<p>"None whatever," said Leycester, "and that is why I am a
great fool in clinging to it."</p>

<p>He got up and began to pace the room, and the color mounted
to his haggard face.</p>

<p>"I cannot&mdash;I cannot shake it off. Charlie, I despise myself;
and yet, no, no, to love her once was to love her for always&mdash;to
the end."</p>

<p>"There's another man, of course," said Lord Charles. "Didn't
it occur to you to&mdash;well, to break his neck, or put a bullet through
him, or get him appointed governor of the Cannibal Islands,
Ley? That used to be your style."</p>

<p>Leycester smiled grimly.</p>

<p>"This man cannot be dealt with in any one of those excellent
ways, Charlie," he said.</p>

<p>"If it's the man I suppose, that fellow Jasper Addled egg&mdash;no,
Adelstone, I should have tried the first at any rate," said
Lord Charles, emphatically.</p>

<p>Leycester shook his head.</p>

<p>"It's a bad business," he said, curtly, "and there is no way of
making it a good one. I will go to bed. What shall we do to-morrow?"
and he sighed.</p>

<p>Lord Charles laid his hand on his arm and kept him for a moment.</p>

<p>"You want rousing, Ley," he said. "Rousing, that's it! Let's
have the horses to-morrow and take a big spin; anywhere, nowhere,
it doesn't matter. We'll go while they can."</p>

<p>Ley nodded.</p>

<p>"Anything you like," he said, and went out.</p>

<p>Lord Charles called to Oliver, who was standing outside smoking
a cigar&mdash;he was quite as particular about the brand as his
master:</p>

<p>"Where did you say the earl and countess were, Oliver?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"At Darlingford Court, my lord."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>"How far is it from here? Can we do it to-morrow with the
nags?"</p>

<p>Oliver thought a moment.</p>

<p>"If they are taken steadily, my lord; not as his lordship has
been riding lately; as if the horse were cast iron and his own
neck too."</p>

<p>Lord Charles nodded.</p>

<p>"All right," he said, "we'll do it. Lord Leycester wants a
change again, Oliver."</p>

<p>Oliver nodded.</p>

<p>"We'll run over there. Needn't say anything to his lordship&mdash;you
understand."</p>

<p>Oliver quite understood, and went off to the small stable to
see about the horses, and Lord Charles went to bed chuckling
over his little plot.</p>

<p>When they started in the morning, Leycester asked no questions
and displayed the supremest indifference to the route, and
Lord Charles, affecting a little indecision, made for the road to
which Oliver had directed him.</p>

<p>The two friends rode almost in silence as was their wont, Leycester
paying very little attention to anything excepting his
horse, and scarcely noticing the fact that Lord Charles seemed
very decided about the route.</p>

<p>Once he asked a question; it was when the evening was drawing
in, and they were still riding, as to their destination, but
Lord Charles evaded it:</p>

<p>"We shall get somewhere, I expect," he said quietly. "There
is sure to be an inn&mdash;or something."</p>

<p>And Leycester was content.</p>

<p>About dusk they reached the entrance to Darlingford. There
was no village, no inn. Leycester pulled up and waited indifferently.</p>

<p>"What do we do now?" he asked.</p>

<p>Lord Charles laughed, but rather consciously.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said: "I know some people who have got
this place. We'd better ride up and get a night's lodging."</p>

<p>Leycester looked at him, and smiled suddenly.</p>

<p>"Isn't this rather transparent, Charlie?" he said, calmly. "Of
course you intended to come here from the very start, very
well."</p>

<p>"Well, I suspect I did," said Lord Charles. "You don't
mind?"</p>

<p>Leycester shook his head.</p>

<p>"Not at all. They will let us go to bed, I suppose. You can
tell them that you are traveling keeper to a melancholy monomaniac,
and they'll leave me alone. Mind, we start in the
morning."</p>

<p>"All right," said Lord Charles, chuckling inwardly&mdash;"of
course; quite so. Come on."</p>

<p>They rode up the avenue, and to the front of a straggling
stone mansion, and a groom came forward and took their horses.
Lord Charles drew Leycester's arm within his.</p>

<p>"We shall be sure of a welcome."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>And he walked up a broad flight of steps.</p>

<p>But Leycester stopped suddenly; for a figure came out of one
of the windows, and stood looking down at them.</p>

<p>It was a woman, gracefully and beautifully dressed in some
softly-hued evening robe. He could not see her face, but he
knew her, and turned almost angrily to Lord Charles. But Lord
Charles had slipped away, muttering something about the horses,
and Leycester went slowly up.</p>

<p>Lenore&mdash;it was she&mdash;awaited his approach all unconsciously.
She could not see him as plainly as he saw her, and she took
him for some strange chance visitor.</p>

<p>But as he came up and stood in front of her she recognized
him, and, with a low cry, she moved toward him, her lovely
face suddenly smitten pale, her violet eyes fixed on him yearningly.</p>

<p>"Leycester!" she said, and overcome for the moment by the
suddenness of his presence, she staggered slightly.</p>

<p>He could do no less than put his arm round her, for he thought
she would have fallen, and as he did so his heart reproached
him, for the one word "Leycester," and the tone told her story.
His mother was right. She loved him.</p>

<p>"Lenore," he said, and his deep, grave, musical voice trembled
slightly. She lay back in his arms for a moment, looking
up at him with an expression of helpless resignation in her eyes,
her lovely face revealed in the light which poured from the window
full upon her.</p>

<p>"Lenore," he said, huskily, "what&mdash;what is this?"</p>

<p>Her eyes closed for a moment, and a faint thrill ran through
her, then she regained her composure, and putting him gently
from her, she laughed softly.</p>

<p>"It was your fault," she said, the exquisite voice tremulous
with emotion. "Why do you steal upon us like a thief in
the night, or&mdash;like a ghost? You frightened me."</p>

<p>He stood and looked at her, and put his hand to his brow. He
was but mortal, was but a man with a man's passions, a man's
susceptibility to woman's loveliness, and he knew that she loved
him.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;&mdash;" he said, then stopped. "I did not know. Charlie
brought me here. Who are here?"</p>

<p>"They are all here," she said, her eyes downcast. "I will go
and tell them lest you frighten them as you frightened me,"
and she stole away from him like a shadow.</p>

<p>He stood, his hands thrust in his pockets, his eyes fixed on the
ground.</p>

<p>She was very beautiful, and she loved him. Why should he
not make her happy? make one person happy at least? Not
only one person, but his mother, and Lilian&mdash;all of them. As for
himself, well! one woman was as good as another, seeing that
he had lost his darling! And this other was the best and rarest
of all that were left.</p>

<p>"Leycester!"</p>

<p>It was his mother's voice. He turned and kissed her; she
was not frightened, she did not even kiss him, but she put her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
hand on his arm, and he felt it tremble, and the way she spoke
the word told of all her past sorrow at his absence, and her joy
at his return.</p>

<p>"You have come back to us!" she said, and that was all.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have come back!" he said, with something like a
sigh.</p>

<p>She looked at him, and the mother's heart was wrung.</p>

<p>"Have you been ill, Leycester?" she asked, quietly.</p>

<p>"Ill, no," he said, then he laughed a strange laugh. "Do I
look so seedy, my lady?"</p>

<p>"You look&mdash;&mdash;" she began, with sad bitterness, then she stopped.
"Come in."</p>

<p>He followed her in, but at the door he paused and looked out
at the night. As he did so, the vision of the slim, graceful girl,
of his lost darling, seemed to float before him, with pale face,
and wistful, reproachful eyes. He put up his hand with a
strange, despairing gesture, and his lips moved.</p>

<p>"Good-bye!" he murmured. "Oh, my lost love, good-bye!"</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVII">CHAPTER XXXVII.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Lord Charles'</span> little plot had succeeded beyond his expectation.
He had restored the prodigal and shared the fatted calf,
as he deserved to do. Although it was known all over the house,
in five minutes, that Lord Leycester, the heir, had returned,
there was no fuss, only a pleasant little simmer of welcome and
satisfaction.</p>

<p>The countess had gone to the earl, who was dressing for
dinner, to tell him the news.</p>

<p>"Leycester has returned," she said.</p>

<p>The earl started and sent his valet away.</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"Yes, he has come back to us," she said, sinking into a
seat.</p>

<p>"Where from?" he demanded.</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I don't want to know. He must be asked
no questions. Lord Charles brought him. I always loved
Charles Guildford."</p>

<p>"So you ought, out of pity," said the earl, grimly, "seeing
that your son has almost led him to ruin."</p>

<p>Then the countess fired up.</p>

<p>"There must be no talk of that kind," she said. "You do not
want to see him go again? No word must be said unless you
want to drive him away. He has been ill."</p>

<p>"I am not surprised," said the earl, still a little grimly, "a
man can't lead the life he has been leading and keep his health,
moral or physical."</p>

<p>"But that is all past," said the countess confidently. "I feel
that is all past. If you do not worry him he will stay, and all
will go well."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I won't worry his Imperial Highness," said the earl,
with a smile, "that is what you want me to say, I suppose.
And the girl&mdash;what about her?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said the countess with all a mother's supreme
indifference for the fate of any other than her son. "She is
past, too. I am sure of that. How thankful I am that Lenore
is here."</p>

<p>"Ah," said the earl who could be sarcastic when he liked.
"So she is to be sacrificed as a thank-offering for the prodigal's
return, is she? Poor Lenore, I am almost sorry for her. She is
too good for him."</p>

<p>"For shame," exclaimed the countess, flushing; "no one is
too good for him. And&mdash;and she will not deem it a sacrifice."</p>

<p>"No, I suppose not," he said, fumbling at his necktie. "It is
well to be born with a handsome face, and a dare-devil temper,
because all women love you then, and the best and fairest think
it worth while to offer themselves up. Poor Lenore! Well, I'll
be civil to his Highness, notwithstanding that he has spent
a small fortune in two months, and declined to honor my
house with his presence. There," he added, touching her cheek
and smiling, "don't be alarmed. We will kill the fatted calf
and make merry&mdash;till he goes off again."</p>

<p>The countess was satisfied with this, and went down to find
Leycester and Lord Charles standing near the fire. Though they
had only rented the place for a month, curtains were up on all
the doors, and there was a fire in all the sitting-rooms, and in
the earl's apartments.</p>

<p>The countess held out her hand to Lord Charles.</p>

<p>"I am very glad to see you, Charlie," she said, with her rare
smile. "You can give me a kiss if you like," and Charlie, as he
blushed and kissed the white forehead, knew that she was thanking
him for bringing her son back to her.</p>

<p>"But we've got to go back at once," he said, with a laugh.</p>

<p>"We can't sit down in this rig out," and he looked ruefully at
his riding suit.</p>

<p>The countess shook her head.</p>

<p>"You shall sit down in a smock frock if you like," she said.
"But there is no occasion. I have brought Leycester's things
down, and&mdash;it's not the first time you have borrowed suits from
each other, I expect."</p>

<p>"Not by a many!" laughed Lord Charles. "I'll go and dress.
Where is Ley?"</p>

<p>Leycester had gone out of the room quietly, and was then sitting
beside Lilian, his hand in hers, her head upon his breast.</p>

<p>"You have come back to us, Ley?" she said, caressing his
hand. "It has been so long and weary waiting! You will not
go again?"</p>

<p>He paused a moment, then he looked at her.</p>

<p>"No," he said, in a low voice. "No, Lil, I shall not go
again."</p>

<p>She kissed him, and as she did so, whispered, anxiously:</p>

<p>"And&mdash;and&mdash;Stella, Ley?"</p>

<p>His face contracted with a frown of pain and trouble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is all past," he said, using his mother's words; and she
kissed him again.</p>

<p>"How thin and worn you look. Oh, Ley!" she murmured, with
sorrowful, loving reproach.</p>

<p>He smiled with a touch of bitterness.</p>

<p>"Do I? Well, I will wax fat and grow mirthful for the
future," he said, rising. "There is the dinner bell."</p>

<p>"Come to me afterward, Ley," she pleaded, as she let him go,
and he promised.</p>

<p>There was to be no fuss, but it was noteworthy that several of
Leycester's favorite dishes figured in the menu, and that there
was a special Indian curry for Lord Charles.</p>

<p>Leycester did not descend to the dining-room till ten minutes
after the time, and the greeting between father and son was characteristic
of the two men. The earl put out his thin, white hand,
and smiled gravely.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Leycester," he said. "Will you have the
Lafitte or the Chateau Margaux? The weather is fine for the
time of year."</p>

<p>And Leycester said, quietly:</p>

<p>"I hope you are well, sir. The Margaux, I suppose, Charles?
Yes, we have had some good weather."</p>

<p>That was all.</p>

<p>He went to his place and sat down quietly and composedly, as
if he had dined with them for months without a break, and as
if the papers had not been chronicling his awful doings.</p>

<p>The earl could not suppress a pang of pity as he glanced across
at the handsome face and saw how worn and haggard it looked,
and he bent his head over his soup with a sigh.</p>

<p>Leycester looked round the table presently, and then turned to
the countess.</p>

<p>"Where is Lenore?" he asked.</p>

<p>The countess paused a moment.</p>

<p>"She has rather a bad headache, and begged to be excused,"
she said.</p>

<p>Leycester bent his head.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," he remarked.</p>

<p>Then the countess talked, and Lord Charles helped her. He
was in the best of spirits. The dinner was excellent, and the
curry admirable, considering the short notice; and he was delighted
with the success of his maneuver. He rattled on in his
humorous style, told them all about the hut, and represented that
they lived somewhat after the manner of savages.</p>

<p>"Eat our meals with a hunting knife, don't we, Leycester?
I hope you'll excuse us if we don't hold our forks properly. I
daresay we shall soon get into the way of it again."</p>

<p>All this was very well, and the earl smiled and grew cheerful;
but the countess, watching the haggard, handsome face beside
her, saw that Leycester was absorbed and pre-occupied. He
passed dish after dish, and the Margaux stood beside him almost
untouched. She was still anxious and fearful, and as she rose
she threw a glance at the earl, half of entreaty, half of command,
that he would not "say anything."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is nice to get back to the old wine," said Charlie, leaning
back in his chair, and eying his glass with complacent approval.
"Whisky and water is a fine drink, but one tires of it; now
this&mdash;&mdash;" and he reached the claret jug expressively.</p>

<p>The earl talked of politics and the coming hunting season, and
still Leycester was silent, eying the white cloth and fingering
the stem of his wine glass.</p>

<p>"Will you hunt this year, Leycester?" said the earl, addressing
him at last.</p>

<p>He looked up gravely.</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir; only a day a week if I do."</p>

<p>"We shall go to Leicestershire, of course," said the earl. "I
shall have to be up for the season, but you can take charge if you
will."</p>

<p>Leycester inclined his head.</p>

<p>"Will you see to the horses?" asked the earl.</p>

<p>Leycester thought a moment.</p>

<p>"I shall only want two," he said; "the rest will be sold."</p>

<p>"Do you mean the stud?" asked the earl, with a faint air of
surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Leycester, quietly. "I shall sell them all. I shall
not race again."</p>

<p>The earl understood him; the old wild life was to come to an
end. But he put in a word.</p>

<p>"Is that wise?" he said.</p>

<p>"I think so," said Leycester. "Quite enough money has been
spent. Yes, I shall sell."</p>

<p>"Very well," assented the earl, who could not but agree with
the remark respecting money. "After all, I imagine one tires
of the turf. I always thought it a great bore."</p>

<p>"So it is&mdash;so it is," said Lord Charles, cheerfully. "Everything
is a bore."</p>

<p>The earl smiled.</p>

<p>"Not everything," he said. "Leycester, you are not touching
the wine," he added, graciously.</p>

<p>Leycester filled his glass and drank it, and then, to Charles'
surprise, refilled it, not once only, but twice and thrice, as if he
had suddenly become thirsty.</p>

<p>Presently the earl, after vainly pushing the decanter to them,
rose, and they followed him into the drawing-room.</p>

<p>The countess sat at her tea-table, and beside her was Lenore.
She was rather paler than usual, and the beautiful eyes were of a
deep violet under the long sweeping lashes. She was exquisitely
dressed, but there was not a single jewel about her; a spray of white
orchid nestled on her bosom and shone in her golden hair, showing
the exquisite delicacy of the fair face and throat. Leycester
glanced at her, but took his cup of tea without a word, and
Lord Charles made all the conversation, as at the dinner-table.</p>

<p>Presently Leycester put down his cup and walked to the window,
and drawing the curtain aside, stood looking out at the
night. There was a flush of color in his face, owing perhaps to
the Margaux, and a strange light in his eyes. What did he see
in the darkness? Was it the spirit of Stella to whom he had said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
farewell? He stood wrapt in thought, the buzz of conversation
and the occasional laugh of Charlie behind him; then suddenly
he turned and went up to the silent figure with the while flower
in its bosom and its hair, and sat down beside her.</p>

<p>"Are you better?" he asked.</p>

<p>She just glanced at him, and smiled slowly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am quite well. It was only a headache."</p>

<p>"Are you well enough to come on to the terrace&mdash;there is a
terrace, is there not?"</p>

<p>"A balcony."</p>

<p>"Will you come? It is quite warm."</p>

<p>She rose at once, and he took up a shawl and put it round her,
and offered her his arm.</p>

<p>She just laid her finger-tips on it, and he led her to the window.
She drew back, and smiled over her shoulder.</p>

<p>"It is a capital offence to open a window at night."</p>

<p>"I forgot," he said. "You see, I am so great a stranger, that
I fail to remember the habits of my own people. Will you show
me the way round?"</p>

<p>"This way," she said; and opening a small door, she took him
into a conservatory, and thence to the balcony.</p>

<p>They were silent for a moment or two&mdash;he looking at the stars,
she with eyes bent to the ground. He was fighting for resolution
and determination, she was silently waiting, knowing what was
passing in his heart, and wondering, with a throbbing heart,
whether her hour of triumph had come.</p>

<p>She had stooped to the very dust to win him, to snatch him
from that other girl who had ensnared him; but as she stood
now and glanced at him&mdash;at the tall, graceful figure, and the
handsome face, all the handsomer in her eyes for its haggardness&mdash;she
felt that she could have stooped still lower if it had
been possible. Her heart beat with expectant passion&mdash;she longed
for the moment when she could rest upon his breast and confess
her love. Why did he not speak?</p>

<p>He turned to her at last, and spoke.</p>

<p>"Lenore," he said, and his voice was deep and earnest,
almost solemn, "I want to ask you a question. Will you answer
me?"</p>

<p>"Ask it," she said, and she raised her eyes to his with a sudden
flash.</p>

<p>"When you saw me to-night, when I came in unexpectedly,
you were&mdash;moved. Was it because you were glad to see me?"</p>

<p>She was silent a moment.</p>

<p>"Is that a fair question?" she murmured.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "Yes, Lenore; we will not trifle with
each other, you and I. If you were glad to see me, do not
hesitate to say so; it is not idle vanity that prompts the question."</p>

<p>She faltered and turned her head away.</p>

<p>"Why will you press me?" she murmured in a low, tremulous
voice. "Do you wish to see me ashamed?" Then she turned
to him suddenly, and the violet eyes met his with a light of passionate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
love in their depths. "But I will answer it," she said.
"Yes, I was glad."</p>

<p>He was silent for a moment, then he drew closer to her and
bent over her.</p>

<p>"Lenore, will you be my wife?"</p>

<p>She did not speak, but looked at him.</p>

<p>"Will you be my wife?" he repeated, almost fiercely; her
supreme loveliness was telling upon him; the light in her eyes
was sinking to his heart and stirring his pulses. "Tell me, Lenore,
do you love me?"</p>

<p>Her head drooped, then she sighed.</p>

<p>"Yes, I love you," she said, and almost imperceptibly swayed
toward him.</p>

<p>He took her in his arms, his heart beating, his brain whirling,
for the memory of that other love seemed to haunt him even at
that moment.</p>

<p>"You love me!" he murmured, hoarsely, looking back on the
night of the past. "Can it be true, Lenore? You!"</p>

<p>She nestled on his breast and looked up at him, and from the
pale face the dark eyes gleamed passionately.</p>

<p>"Leycester," she breathed, "you know I love you! You know
it!"</p>

<p>He pressed her closer to him, then a hoarse cry broke from
him.</p>

<p>"God forgive me!"</p>

<p>It was a strange response at such a moment.</p>

<p>"Why do you say that?" she asked, looking up at him; his
face was haggard and remorseful, anything but as a lover's face
should be, but he smiled gravely and kissed her.</p>

<p>"It is strange!" he said, as if in explanation&mdash;"strange that
I should have won your love, I who am so unworthy, while you
are so peerless!"</p>

<p>She trembled a little with a sudden qualm of fear. If he
could but know of what she had been guilty to win him! It was
she who was unworthy! But she put the fear from her. She
had got him, and she did not doubt her power to hold him.</p>

<p>"Do not speak of unworthiness," she murmured, lovingly.
"We have both passed through the world, Leycester, and have
learned to value true love. You have always had mine," she
added, in a faint whisper.</p>

<p>What could he do but kiss her? But even as he took her in
his arms and laid his hand on the shapely head with its golden
wealth, a subtle pain thrilled at his heart, and he felt as if he
were guilty of some treachery.</p>

<p>They stood for some time almost in silence&mdash;she was too wise
to disturb his mood&mdash;side by side; then he put her arm in his.</p>

<p>"Let us go in," he said. "Shall I tell my mother to-night,
Lenore?"</p>

<p>"Why not," she murmured, leaning against him, and with
the upturned eyes glowing into his with suppressed passion and
devotion. "Why not? Will they not be glad, do you think?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, and he remembered how differently Stella had
spoken. "After all," he thought with a sigh, "I shall make a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
great many persons happy and comfortable. Very well," he
said, "I will see them."</p>

<p>He stooped to kiss her before they passed into the light, and
she did not shrink from his kiss; but put up her lips and met it
with one in return.</p>

<p>There were men, and not a few, who would have given some
years of their life for such a kiss from the beautiful Lenore, but
he, Leycester, took it without a thrill, without an extra heartbeat.</p>

<p>There was not much need to tell them what had happened;
the countess knew in a moment by Lenore's face&mdash;pale, but
with a light of triumph glowing in it&mdash;that the hour had come,
and that she had won.</p>

<p>In her graceful manner, she went up to the countess, and bent
over to kiss her.</p>

<p>"I am going up now, dear," she said, in a whisper. "I am
rather tired."</p>

<p>The countess embraced her.</p>

<p>"Not too tired to see me if I come?" she said, in a whisper,
and Lady Lenore shook her head.</p>

<p>She put her hand in Leycester's for a moment, as he opened
the door for her, and looked into his face; but he would not let
her go so coldly, and raising her hand to his lips, said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good-night, Lenore."</p>

<p>The earl started and stared at this familiar salutation, and
Lord Charles raised his eyebrows; but Leycester came to the
fire, and stood looking into it for a minute in silence.</p>

<p>Then he turned to them and said, in his quiet way&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lenore has promised to be my wife. Have you any objection,
sir?"</p>

<p>The earl started and looked at him, and then held out his hand
with an emphatic nod.</p>

<p>"Objection! It is about the wisest thing you ever did, Leycester."</p>

<p>Leycester smiled at him strangely, and turned to his mother.
She did not speak, but her eyes filled, and she put her hand on
his shoulder and kissed him.</p>

<p>"My dear Leycester, I congratulate you!" exclaimed Charlie,
wringing his hand and beaming joyously. "'Pon my word,
this is the&mdash;the happiest thing we've come across for many a
day! By George!"</p>

<p>And having dropped Leycester's hand, he seized that of the
earl, and wrung that, and would in turn have seized the
countess's, had she not given it to him of her own free will.</p>

<p>"We have to thank you in some measure for this, Charles,"
she said, in a low voice, and with a grateful smile.</p>

<p>Leycester leant against the mantel-shelf, his hands behind him,
his face set and thoughtful, almost absent, indeed. He had the
appearance of a man in a dream.</p>

<p>The earl roused him with a word or two.</p>

<p>"This is very good news, Leycester."</p>

<p>"I am very glad you are pleased, sir," said Leycester, quietly.</p>

<p>"I am more than pleased, I am delighted," responded the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
earl, in his quiet way. "I may say that it is the fulfillment of a
hope I have cherished for some time. I trust, more, I believe,
you will be happy. If you are not," he added, with a smile, "it
will be your own fault."</p>

<p>Leycester smiled grimly.</p>

<p>"No doubt, sir," he said.</p>

<p>The old earl passed his white hands over each other&mdash;just as he
did in the House when he was about to make a speech.</p>

<p>"Lenore is one of the most beautiful and charming women it
has been my fate to meet; she has been regarded by your
mother, and I may say by myself, as a daughter. The prospect
of receiving her at your hands as one in very truth affords me
the most intense pleasure."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," said Leycester.</p>

<p>The earl coughed behind his hand.</p>

<p>"I suppose," he said, with a glance at the haggard face,
"there will be no delay in making your happiness complete?"</p>

<p>Leycester almost started.</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I mean your marriage," said the earl, staring at him, and
wondering why he should be so dense and altogether grim, "of
course, of course, your marriage. The sooner the better, my
dear Leycester. There will be preparations to make, and they
always take time. I think, if you can persuade Lenore to fix an
early date, I would see Harbor and Harbor"&mdash;the family solicitors&mdash;"at
once. I need hardly say that anything I can do to
expedite matters I will do gladly. I think you always had a
fancy for the place in Scotland&mdash;you shall have that; and as to
the house in town, well if you haven't already thought of a
place, there is the house in the square&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Leycester's face flushed for a moment.</p>

<p>"You are very good to me, sir," he said; and for the first time
his voice showed some feeling.</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" said the earl cordially. "You know that I
would do anything, everything to make your future a happy
one. Talk it over with Lenore!"</p>

<p>"I will, sir," said Leycester. "I think I will go up to Lilian
now, she expects me."</p>

<p>The earl took his hand and shook it as he had not shaken it for
many a day, and Leycester went up-stairs.</p>

<p>The countess had left the room, but he found her waiting for
him.</p>

<p>"Good-night, mother," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, Leycester, you have made me&mdash;all of us&mdash;so happy!"</p>

<p>"Ay," he said, and he smiled at her. "I am very glad.
Heaven knows I have often enough made you unhappy,
mother."</p>

<p>"No, no," she said, kissing him; "this makes up for all&mdash;for
all!"</p>

<p>Leycester watched her as she went down-stairs, and a sigh
broke from him.</p>

<p>"Not one of them understands, not one," he murmured.</p>

<p>But there was one watching for him who understood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>"Leycester," she said, holding out her hands to him and
almost rising.</p>

<p>He sat on the head of the couch and put his hand on her head.</p>

<p>"Mamma has just told me, Ley," she murmured. "I am so
glad, so glad. I have never been so happy."</p>

<p>He was silent, his fingers caressing her cheek.</p>

<p>"It is what we have all been hoping and praying for, Ley!
She is so good and sweet, and so true."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, little guessing at her falsity.</p>

<p>"And, Ley&mdash;she loves you so dearly."</p>

<p>"Aye," he said, with almost a groan.</p>

<p>She looked up at him and saw his face, and her own changed
color; her hand stole up to his.</p>

<p>"Oh, Ley, Ley," she murmured, piteously. "You have forgotten
all that?"</p>

<p>He smiled, not bitterly but sadly.</p>

<p>"Forgotten? No," he said; "such things are not easily forgotten.
But it is past, and I am going to forget now, Lil."</p>

<p>Even as he spoke he seemed to see the loving face, with its
trusting smile, floating before him.</p>

<p>"Yes, Ley, dear Ley, for her sake. For Lenore's sake."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, grimly, "for hers and for my own."</p>

<p>"You will be so happy; I know it, I feel it. No one could
help loving her, and every day you will learn to love her more
dearly, and the past will fade away and be forgotten, Ley."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, in a low, absent voice.</p>

<p>She said no more, and they sat hand in hand wrapped in
thought. Even when he got up to go he said nothing, and his
hand as it held hers was as cold as ice.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVIII">CHAPTER XXXVIII.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> had come so suddenly as to almost overwhelm her; the
great gift of the gods that she had been waiting, aye, and plotting
for, had fallen to her at last, and her cup of triumph was
full to overbrimming, but at the same time she, as Lord Charles
would have put it, "kept her head." She thoroughly understood
how and why she had gained her will. She could read
Leycester as if he were a book, and she knew that, although he
had asked her to be his wife, he had not forgotten that other girl
with the brown hair and dark eyes&mdash;that "Stella," the painter's
niece.</p>

<p>This was a bitter pang to her, a drop of gall to her cup, but she
accepted it.</p>

<p>Just as Jasper said of Stella, so she said of Leycester.</p>

<p>"I will make him love me!" she thought. "The time shall
come when he will wonder how he came to think of that other,
and be filled with self-contempt for having so thought of her."
And she set about her work well. Some women in the hour of
their triumph, would have shown their delight, and so worried,
or perhaps disgusted, their lover; but not so did Lady Lenore.</p>

<p>She took matters with an ineffable calm and serenity, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
never for one moment allowed it to be seen how much she had
gained on that eventful evening.</p>

<p>To Leycester her manner was simply charming. She exerted
herself to win him without permitting the effort to be even
guessed at.</p>

<p>Her very beauty seemed to grow more brilliant and bewitching.
She moved about the place "like a poem," as Lord Charles
declared. Her voice, always soft and musical, with unexpected
harmonies, that charmed by their very surprises, was like music;
and, more important still, it was seldom heard. She exacted
none of the privileges of an engaged woman; she did not expect
Leycester to sit with her by the hour, or walk about with her all
day, or to whisper tender speeches, and lavish secret caresses.
Indeed, she almost seemed to avoid being alone with him; in
fact she humored him to the top of his bent, so that he did not
even feel the chain with which he had bound himself.</p>

<p>And he was grateful to her; gradually the charm of her presence,
the music of her voice, the feeling that she belonged to
him told upon him, and he found himself at times sitting,
watching, and listening to her with a strange feeling of pleasure.
He was only mortal and she was not only supremely beautiful,
but supremely clever. She had set herself to charm him, and
he would have been less, or more than man, if he had been able
to resist her.</p>

<p>So it happened that he was left much to himself, for Charlie,
thinking himself rather <i>de trop</i> and in the way, had taken himself
off to join his shooting party, and Leycester spent most of
his time wandering about the coast or riding over the hills,
generally returning at dinner-time tired and thoughtful, and
very often expecting some word or look of complaint from his
beautiful betrothed.</p>

<p>But they never came. Exquisitely dressed, she always met
him with the same serene smile, in which there was just a suggestion
of tenderness she could not express, and never a question
as to where he had been.</p>

<p>After dinner he would come and sit beside her, leaning back
and watching her, too often absently, and listening to her as she
talked to the others. To him she very seldom said much, but if he
chanced to ask her for anything&mdash;to play or to sing&mdash;she obeyed
instantly, as if he were already her lord and master. It touched
him, her simple-minded devotion and thorough comprehension
of him&mdash;touched him as no display of affection on her part
would have done.</p>

<p>"Heaven help her, she loves me!" he thought, often and
often. "And I!"</p>

<p>One evening they chanced to be alone together&mdash;he had come
in after dinner, having eaten some sort of meal at a shooting
lodge on the adjoining estate&mdash;and found her seated by the
window, her white hands in her lap, a rapt look on her face.</p>

<p>She looked so supremely lovely, so rapt and solitary that his
heart smote him, and he went up to her, his step making no
sound on the thick carpet, and kissed her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>She started and looked up with a burning blush which transfigured
her for a moment, then she said, quietly:</p>

<p>"Is that you, Leycester? Have you dined?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, with a pang of self-reproach. "Why should
you think of that? I do not deserve that you should care
whether I dine or not."</p>

<p>She smiled up at him; her eyebrows arched themselves.</p>

<p>"Should it not? But I do care, very much. Have you?"</p>

<p>He nodded impatiently.</p>

<p>"Yes. You do not even ask me where I have been?"</p>

<p>"No," she murmured, softly. "I can wait until you tell me;
it is for you to tell me, and for me to wait."</p>

<p>Such submission, such meekness from her who was pride and
hauteur personified to others, amazed him.</p>

<p>"By Heaven, Lenore!" he exclaimed, in a low voice, "there
never was a woman like you."</p>

<p>"No?" she said. "I am glad you will have something that is
unique then."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "I shall." Then he said, suddenly, "When
am I to possess my gem, Lenore?"</p>

<p>She started, and turned her face from him.</p>

<p>He looked down at her, and put his hand on her shoulder,
white and warm and responsive to his touch.</p>

<p>"Lenore, let it be soon. We will not wait. Why should we?
Let us make ourselves and all the rest of them happy."</p>

<p>"Will it make you happy?" she asked.</p>

<p>It was a dangerous question, but the impulse was too strong.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, and indeed he thought so. "Can you say the
same, Lenore?"</p>

<p>She did not answer, but she took his hand and laid it against
her cheek. It was the action of a slave&mdash;a beautiful and
exquisitely-graceful woman, but a slave.</p>

<p>He drew his hand away and winced with remorse.</p>

<p>"Come," he said, bending over her, "let me tell them that it
shall be next month."</p>

<p>"So soon?" she murmured.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, almost impatiently. "Why should we wait?
They are all impatient. I am impatient, naturally, but they all
wish it. Let it be next month, Lenore."</p>

<p>She looked up at him.</p>

<p>"Very well," she said, in a low voice.</p>

<p>He bent over her, and put his arm round her, and there was
something almost desperate in his face as he looked up at her.</p>

<p>"Lenore," he said, in a low voice, "I wish, to Heaven I wish
I were worthy of you!"</p>

<p>"Hush!" she whispered, "you are too good to me. I am quite
content, Leycester&mdash;quite content."</p>

<p>Then, as her head rested on his shoulder, she whispered, "There
is only one thing, Leycester, I should like&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She paused.</p>

<p>"What is it, Lenore?"</p>

<p>"It is about the place," she said. "You will not mind where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
it takes place, will you? I do not want to be married at Wyndward."</p>

<p>This was so exactly in accordance with his own wishes that
he started.</p>

<p>"Not at Wyndward!" he said, hesitating. "Why?"</p>

<p>She was silent a moment.</p>

<p>"Fancy," she said, with a little rippling laugh. "Fancies are
permitted one at such times, you know."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," he said. "I know my mother and father would
wish it to be there&mdash;or in London."</p>

<p>"Nor in London," she said, almost quickly. "Leycester, why
should it not be here?"</p>

<p>He was silent. This again would be in accordance with his
own desire.</p>

<p>"I should like a quiet wedding," she said. "Oh! very quiet."</p>

<p>"You!" he exclaimed, incredulously. "You, whose marriage
would at any time have so much interest for the world in which
you have moved&mdash;reigned, rather!"</p>

<p>She laughed again.</p>

<p>"It has always been one of my day-dreams to steal away to
church with the man I loved, and be married without the usual
fuss and formality."</p>

<p>He looked at her with a gleam of pleasure and relief in his
eyes, little dreaming that it was for his sake she had made the
proposal.</p>

<p>"How strange!" he muttered. "It&mdash;well, it is unlike what
one fancies of you, Lenore."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," she said, with a smile, "but it is true, nevertheless.
If I may choose, I would like to go down to the little
church there, and be married like a farmer's daughter, or, if not
that exactly, as quietly as possible."</p>

<p>He rose and stood looking out of the window, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I shall never understand you, Lenore." he said; "but this
pleases me very much indeed. It has always been my day-dream,
as you call it,"&mdash;he smothered a sigh. "Certainly it
shall be as you wish! Why should it not be?"</p>

<p>"Very well," she said; "then that is agreed. No announcements,
no fuss, no St. George's, Hanover Square, and no bishop!"
and she rose and laughed softly.</p>

<p>He looked at her, and smiled.</p>

<p>"You appear in a new light every day, Lenore," he said. "If
you had expressed my own thoughts and desires, you could not
have hit them off more exactly; what will the mother say?"</p>

<p>The countess had a great deal to say about the matter. She
declared that it was absurd, that it was worse than absurd; it
was preposterous.</p>

<p>"It is all very well to talk of a farmer's daughter, my dear,
but you are not a farmer's daughter; you are Lady Lenore
Beauchamp, and he is the next earl. The world will say you
have both taken leave of your senses."</p>

<p>Lenore looked at her with a sudden gleam in her violet eyes.</p>

<p>"Do you think I care?" she said, in a low voice&mdash;Leycester
was not present. "I would not care whether we were married<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
in Westminster Abbey, by the archbishop himself, with all the
Court in attendance, or in a village chapel. It is not I, though
I say so. It is for him. Say no more about it, dear Lady Wyndward;
his lightest wish is law to me."</p>

<p>And the countess obeyed. The passionate devotion of the
haughty beauty astonished even her, who knew something of
what a woman's love can be capable of.</p>

<p>"My dear," she murmured, "do not give way too much."</p>

<p>The beauty smiled a strange smile.</p>

<p>"It is not a question of giving way," she retorted, with suppressed
emotion. "It is simply that his wish is my law; I have
but to obey&mdash;it will always be so, always." Then she slipped
down beside the countess, and looked up with a sudden pallor.</p>

<p>"Do you not understand yet how I love him?" she said, with a
smile. "No, I do not think anyone can understand but myself&mdash;but
myself!"</p>

<p>The earl offered no remonstrance or objection.</p>

<p>"What does it matter!" he said. "The place is of no consequence.
The marriage is the thing. The day Leycester is married,
a heavy load of care and apprehension and I shall be
divorced. Let them be married where they like, in Heaven's
name."</p>

<p>So Harbor and Harbor were set to work, and the principal of
that old-established and aristocratic firm came all the way down
to Devonshire, and was closeted with the earl for a couple of
hours, and the settlement deeds were put in hand.</p>

<p>Lady Lenore's fortune, which was a large one, was to be settled
upon herself, supplemented by another large fortune from
the hand of the earl. So large, that the lawyer ventured on a
word of remonstrance, but the earl put it aside with a wave of
the hand.</p>

<p>"It is the same amount as that which was settled upon the
countess," he said. "Why should my son's wife have less?"</p>

<p>Quiet as the betrothal had been, and quietly as the nuptials
were to be, rumors had spread, and presents were arriving daily.
If Lenore could have found any particular pleasure in precious
gems, and gold-fitted dressing-bags, and ivory prayer-books,
there they were in endless variety for her delight, but they afforded
her none beyond the fact of their being evidence of her
coming happiness.</p>

<p>One present alone brought her joy, and that was Leycester's, and
that not because the diamonds of which the necklet was composed
were large and almost priceless, but for the fact that he
fastened the jewels round her neck with his own hands.</p>

<p>"These are my necklets," she murmured, taking his hands as
they touched her neck and pressing them.</p>

<p>How could he resist her?</p>

<p>And yet as the time moved on with that dogged obstinacy
which it assumes for us while we would rather have it pause
awhile, something of the old moodiness seemed to take possession
of him. The long walks and rides grew longer, and often
he would not return until late in the night, and then weary and
listless. At such times it was Lenore who made excuses for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
him, if by chance the countess uttered a word of comment or
complaint.</p>

<p>"Why should he not do as he likes?" she said, with a smile.
"It is I who am the slave, not he."</p>

<p>But alone in her chamber, where already the signs of the approaching
wedding were showing themselves in the shape of
new dresses and wedding <i>trousseau</i>, the anguish of unrequited
love overmastered her. Pacing to and fro, with clasped hands
and pale face, she would utter the old moan, the old prayer,
which the gods have heard since the world was young:</p>

<p>"Give me his love&mdash;give me his love! Take all else but let
his heart turn to me, and to me only!"</p>

<p>If Stella could have known it, she was justly avenged already.
Not even the anguish she had endured surpassed that of the
proud beauty who had helped to rob her, and who had given her
own heart to the man who had none to give her in return.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXXIX">CHAPTER XXXIX.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">"It</span> certainly must have been made a hundred years after the
rest of the world," said Mr. Etheridge. "Where on earth did
you hear of it, Jasper?"</p>

<p>They were standing, the painter, Jasper, and Stella, on the
little stretch of beach that fronted the tiny village of Carlyon,
with its cluster of rough-stone cottages and weather-beaten
church, the whole nestling under the shadow of the Cornish
cliffs that kept the east winds at bay and offered a stern face to
the wild seas which so often roared and raged at its base.</p>

<p>Jasper smiled.</p>

<p>"I can't exactly say, sir," he answered. "I met with it by
chance, and it seemed to me just the place for our young invalid.
You like it, Stella, I hope?" and he turned to Stella with a softened
smile.</p>

<p>Stella was leaning on the old man's arm, looking out to sea,
with a far-away expression in her dark eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, quietly; "I like it."</p>

<p>"Stella likes any place that is far from the madding crowd,"
remarked Mr. Etheridge, gazing at her affectionately. "You
don't appear to have got back your roses yet, my child, however."</p>

<p>"I am quite well," she said, not so wearily as indifferently.
"I am always well. It is Frank who is ill, you know, uncle."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay," he said, with the expression of gravity which always
came upon him when the boy was mentioned. "He looks
very pale and thin, poor boy."</p>

<p>Stella sighed, but Jasper broke in cheerfully&mdash;</p>

<p>"Better than when he first came," he said. "I noticed the
difference directly I saw him. He will pick up his strength famously,
you will see."</p>

<p>Stella sighed again.</p>

<p>"You must make sketches of this coast," said Jasper, as if
anxious to get away from the subject. "It is particularly picturesque,
especially about the cliffs. There is one view in particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
which you should not fail to take; you get it from the
top of the cliff there."</p>

<p>"Rather a dangerous perch," said Mr. Etheridge, shading his
eyes and looking up.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is," assented Jasper. "I have been trying to impress
the fact upon Stella. It is her favorite haunt, she tells me, and
I am always in fear and trembling when I see her mounting up
to it."</p>

<p>The old man smiled.</p>

<p>"You will soon have the right to protect her," he said, glancing
at the church. "Have you made all the arrangements?"</p>

<p>Jasper's face flushed as he answered, but Stella's remained
pale and set.</p>

<p>"Yes, everything is ready. The clergyman is a charming old
gentleman, and the church is a picture inside. I tell Stella that
one could not have chosen a more picturesque spot."</p>

<p>And he glanced toward her with the watchful smile.</p>

<p>Stella turned her face away.</p>

<p>"It is very pretty," she said, simply. "Shall we go in now?
Frank will be expecting us."</p>

<p>"You must know," said Jasper, "that we are leading the
most rustic of lives&mdash;dinner in the middle of the day, tea at
five o'clock."</p>

<p>"I see," said Mr. Etheridge. "Quite a foretaste of Arcadia!
But, after all," he added, perhaps remembering the long journey
which he had been compelled to take, and which he disliked, "I
can't see why you should not have been married at Wyndward."</p>

<p>Jasper smiled.</p>

<p>"And risk the chance of Lord Leycester turning up at the
last moment and making a scene," he might have answered, if
he had replied candidly; but instead, he said, lightly:</p>

<p>"Oh, that would have been too commonplace for such a
romantic man as your humble servant, sir."</p>

<p>Mr. Etheridge eyed him in his usual grave, abstracted way.</p>

<p>"You are the last person I should have accused of a love of
the romantic," he said.</p>

<p>"Then there was Frank," added Jasper, in a lower voice, but
not too low to reach Stella, for whom the addition was intended;
"he wanted a change, and he would not have come without
Stella."</p>

<p>They entered the cottage, in the tiny sitting-room of which
Mrs. Penfold had already set the tea.</p>

<p>Frank was lying on a sofa whose metallic hardness had been
mitigated by cushions and pillows; and certainly if he was pulling
up his strength, as Jasper asserted, it was at a very slow
rate.</p>

<p>He looked thinner than ever, and there was a dark ring under
his eyes which made the hectic flush still more beautiful by contrast
than when we saw him last. He greeted their entrance
with a smile at Stella, and a cold evasive glance at Jasper. She
went and smoothed the pillow at his head; but, as if ashamed
that the other should see his weakness, he rose and walked to
the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>The old man eyed him sadly, but smiled with affected cheerfulness.</p>

<p>"Well, Frank, how do you feel to-night? You must be well
to the front to-morrow, you know, or you will not be the best
man!"</p>

<p>Frank looked up with a sudden flush, then set down without
a word.</p>

<p>"I shall be very well to-morrow," he said. "There is nothing
the matter with me."</p>

<p>Jasper, as usual, cut in with some remark to change the subject,
and, as usual, did all the talking; Stella sat silent, her eyes
fixed on the distant sun sinking slowly to rest. The word "to-morrow"
rang in her ears; this was the last day she could call
her own; to-morrow, and all after to-morrows would be Jasper's.
All the past, full of its sweet hopes and its passionate love, had
gone by and vanished, and to-morrow she would stand at the
altar as Jasper Adelstone's bride. It seemed so great a mockery
as to be unreal, and at times she found herself regarding herself
as another person, in whom she took the merest interest as a
spectator.</p>

<p>It could not be that she, whom Leycester Wyndward had
loved, should be going to marry Jasper Adelstone! Then she
would look at the boy, so thin, and wan, and fading, and love
would give her strength to carry out her sacrifice.</p>

<p>To-night he was very dear to her, and she sat holding his hand
under the table; the thin, frail hand that closed with a spasmodic
gesture of aversion when Jasper's smirkish voice broke in on the
conversation. It was wonderful how the boy hated him.</p>

<p>Presently she whispered&mdash;"You must go and lie down again,
Frank."</p>

<p>"No, not here," he said. "Let me go outside."</p>

<p>And she drew his hand through her arm and went out with him.</p>

<p>Jasper looked after them with a smile.</p>

<p>"Quite touching to see Frank's devotion to Stella," he said.</p>

<p>The old man nodded.</p>

<p>"Poor boy!" he said&mdash;"poor boy!"</p>

<p>Jasper cleared his throat.</p>

<p>"I think he had better come with us on our wedding trip," he
said. "It will give Stella pleasure, I know, and be a comfort to
Frank."</p>

<p>The old man nodded.</p>

<p>"You are very kind and considerate," he said.</p>

<p>"Not at all," responded Jasper. "I would do anything to
insure Stella's happiness. By-the-way, speaking of arrangements,
I have executed a little deed of settlement&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Was that necessary?" asked Mr. Etheridge. "She comes to
you penniless."</p>

<p>"I am not a rich man," said Jasper, meekly, "but I have
secured a sufficient sum upon her to render her independent."</p>

<p>The old man nodded, gratefully.</p>

<p>"You have behaved admirably," he said; "I have no doubt
Stella will be happy. You will bear with her, I hope, Jasper,
and not forget that she is but a girl&mdash;but a girl."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>Jasper inclined his head for a moment in silence. Bear! Little
did the old man know how much he, Jasper, had to bear.</p>

<p>They sat talking for some little time, Jasper listening, as he
talked, to the two voices outside&mdash;the clear, low, musical tones
of Stella, the thin weak voice of the boy. Presently the voices
ceased, and after a time he went out. Frank was sitting in the
sunset light, his head on his hands.</p>

<p>"Where is Stella?" asked Jasper, almost sharply.</p>

<p>Frank looked up at him.</p>

<p>"She has escaped," he said, sardonically.</p>

<p>Jasper started.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"She has gone on the cliffs for a stroll," said Frank, with a
little smile at the alarm he had created and intended to create.</p>

<p>Jasper turned upon him with a suppressed snarl. He was
battling with suppressed excitement to-night.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by escaped?" he demanded.</p>

<p>The hollow sunken eyes glared up at him.</p>

<p>"What did you think I meant?" he retorted. "You need not
be frightened, she will come back," and he laughed bitterly.</p>

<p>Jasper glanced at him again, and after a moment of hesitation
turned and went into the house.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Stella was climbing the steep ascent to the bit of
table-land on the cliff. She felt suffocated and overwhelmed.
"To-morrow! to-morrow!" seemed to ring in her ears. Was
there no escape? As she looked down at the waves rolling in beneath
her, and beating their crested heads against the rocks, she
almost felt as if she could drop down to them and so find escape
and rest. So strong was the feeling, the temptation, that she
shrank back against the cliff, and sank down on dry and chalky
turf, trembling and confused. Suddenly, as she thus sat, she
heard a man's step coming up the cliff, and thinking it was
Jasper, rose and pushed the hair from her face with an effort at
self-command.</p>

<p>But it was not Jasper, it was a straighter, more stalwart figure,
and in a moment, as he stood to look at the sea, she knew
him. It was Leycester, and with a low, inarticulate cry, she
shrank back against the cliff and watched him. He stood for
a while motionless, leaning on his stick, his back turned from
her, then he took up a pebble and dropped it down into the
depths beneath, sighed, and to her intense relief, went down
again.</p>

<p>But though he had not spoken, the sight of him, his dearly-loved
presence so near her, shook her to her center. White and
breathless she leaned against the hard rock, her eyes strained to
catch the last glimpse of him; then she sank on to the ground
and hiding her face in her hands burst into tears.</p>

<p>They were the first tears that she had shed since that awful
day, and every drop seemed of molten fire that scorched her
heart as it flowed from it.</p>

<p>If ever she had persuaded herself that the time might come
when she would cease to love him, she knew, now that she had
seen him again, that she could not so hope again. Never while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
life was left to her should she cease to love him. And to-morrow,
to-morrow.</p>

<p>"Oh, my love, my love!" she murmured, stretching out her
hands as she had done that night in the garden, "come back to
me! I cannot let you go! I cannot do it! I cannot!"</p>

<p>Nerved by the intensity of her grief she sprang to her feet, and
swiftly descended the cliff. Near the bottom there were two
paths, one leading to the village, the other to the open country
beyond. Instinctively she took the one leading to the village,
and so missed Leycester, for he had gone down the other.</p>

<p>Had she but made a different choice, had she turned to the
right instead of the left, how much would have been averted; but she
sped, almost breathlessly to the left, and instead of Leycester
found Jasper waiting for her.</p>

<p>With a low cry she stopped short.</p>

<p>"Where is he?" she asked, almost unconsciously. "Let me
go to him!"</p>

<p>Jasper stared at her, then he grasped her arm.</p>

<p>"You have seen him!" he said, not roughly, not fiercely, but
with a suppressed fury.</p>

<p>There was a rough seat cut out of the stone beside her, and she
sank into it, shrinking away from his eager watching in quest of
that other.</p>

<p>"You have seen him!" he repeated, hoarsely. "Do not deny
it!"</p>

<p>The insult conveyed in the words recalled her to herself.</p>

<p>"Yes!" she said, meeting his gaze steadily; "I have seen
him. Why should I deny it?"</p>

<p>"No," he said; "and you will not deny that you were running
after him when I&mdash;I stopped you. You will admit that, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, with a deadly calm, "I was following
him."</p>

<p>He dropped her arm which he had held, and pressed his hand
to his heart to still the pang of its throbbing.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you are shameless!" he said at last, hoarsely.</p>

<p>She did not speak.</p>

<p>"Do you realize what to-night is?" he said, glaring down at
her. "This is our marriage eve; do you hear&mdash;our marriage
eve?"</p>

<p>She shuddered, and put up her hands to her face.</p>

<p>"Did you plan this meeting?" he demanded, with a fierce
sneer. "You will admit that, I suppose? It is only a mere
chance that I did not find you in his arms; is that so? Curse
him! I wish I had killed him when I met him just now!"</p>

<p>Then the old spirit roused itself in her bosom, and she looked
up at him with a scornful smile on her beautiful, wasting face.</p>

<p>"You!" she said.</p>

<p>That was all, but it seemed to drive him mad. For a moment
he stood breathless and panting.</p>

<p>The sight of his fury and suffering&mdash;for the suffering was palpable&mdash;smote
her.</p>

<p>Her mood changed suddenly; with a cry she caught his arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Jasper, Jasper! Have pity on me!" she cried; "have
pity. You wrong me, you wrong him. He did not come to see
me; he did not know I was here! We have not spoken&mdash;not a
word, not a word!" and she moaned; "but as I stood and
watched him, and saw how changed he was, and heard him
sigh, I knew that he had not forgotten, and&mdash;and my heart went
out to him. I&mdash;I did not mean to speak, to follow him, but I
could not help it. Jasper, you see&mdash;you see, it is impossible&mdash;our
marriage, I mean. Have pity on me and let me go! For
your own sake let me go! Think, think! What satisfaction,
what joy can you hope for? I&mdash;I have tried to love you, Jasper,
but&mdash;but I cannot! All my life is his! Let me go!"</p>

<p>He almost flung her from him, then caught her again with an
oath.</p>

<p>"By Heaven, I will not!" he cried, fiercely. "Once for all, I
will not! Take care, you have made me desperate! It is your
fault if I were to take you at your word."</p>

<p>He paused for breath; then his rage broke out again, more
deadly for its sudden, unnatural quietude.</p>

<p>"Do you think I am blind and bereft of my senses not to
see and understand what this means? Do you think you are
dealing with a child? You have waited your time, and bided
your chance, and you think it has come. Would you have
dared to do this a month ago? No, there was no certainty
of the boy's death then; but now&mdash;now that you see he will
die, you think my power is at an end&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>With a cry she sprang to her feet and confronted him, terror
in her face, an awful fear and sorrow in her eyes. As
the cry left her lips, it seemed to be echoed by another close
behind them, but neither of them noticed it.</p>

<p>"Frank&mdash;die!" she gasped. "No, no; not that! Tell me
that you did not mean it, that you said it only to frighten
me."</p>

<p>He put her imploring hand away with a bitter sneer.</p>

<p>"You would make a good actress," he said, "do you mean
to tell me that you were not counting on his death? Do you
mean to tell me that you would not have wound up the scene
by begging for more time&mdash;time to allow you to escape, as you
would call it! You think that once the boy is dead you can
slip from your bargain and laugh at me! You are mistaken;
since the bargain was struck, I have strove, as no man ever
strove, to make it easy for you, to win your love, because I
loved you. I love you no longer, but I will not let you go.
Love you! As there is a Heaven above us, I hate you to-night,
but you shall not go."</p>

<p>She shrank from him cowering, as he towered above her,
like some beautiful maiden in the old myths shrinking from
some devouring monster.</p>

<p>"Listen to me," he said, hoarsely, "to-morrow I either give
this paper"&mdash;and he snatched the forged bill from his breast
pocket and struck it viciously with his quivering hand&mdash;"I
either give it into your hands as my wife, or I give it to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
nearest magistrate. The boy will die! It rests with you
whether he dies at peace or in a jail."</p>

<p>White and trembling she sat and looked at him.</p>

<p>"This is my answer to your pretty prayer," he said, with a
bitterness incredible. "It is for you to decide&mdash;I use no further
argument. Soft speeches and loving words are thrown away
upon you; besides, the time has passed for them. There is no
love, no particle of love, in my heart for you to-night&mdash;I simply
stand by my bond."</p>

<p>She did not answer him, she scarcely heard him; she was
thinking of that sad face that had appeared to her for a moment
as if in reproach, and vanished ghost-like; and it was to it
that she murmured:</p>

<p>"Oh, my love&mdash;my love!"</p>

<p>He heard her; and his face quivered with speechless rage;
then he laughed.</p>

<p>"You made a great mistake," he said, with a sneer&mdash;"a very
great mistake, if you are invoking Lord Leycester Wyndward.
He may be your love, but you are not his! It is a matter of
small moment&mdash;it does not weigh a feather in the balance between
us&mdash;but the truth is, 'your love' is now Lady Lenore
Beauchamp's!"</p>

<p>Stella looked up at him, and smiled wearily.</p>

<p>"A lie? No," he said, shaking his head tauntingly. "I have
known it for weeks past. It is in every London paper. But
that is nothing as between you and me&mdash;I stand by my bond.
To-morrow the boy's fate lies in your hands or in that of the
police. I have no more to say&mdash;I await your answer. I do not
even demand it to-night&mdash;no doubt you would be&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She arose, white and calm, her eyes fixed on him.</p>

<p>"&mdash;I say I await your answer till to-morrow. Acts, not
words, I require. Fulfill your part of the bargain, and I will
fulfill mine."</p>

<p>As he spoke he folded the forged bill which, in his excitement,
had blown open, and put it slowly into his pocket again; then
he wiped his brow and looked at her, biting his lip moodily.</p>

<p>"Will you come with me now," he said, "or will you wait
and consider your course of action?"</p>

<p>His question seemed to rouse her; she raised her head, and
disregarding his proffered arm, went slowly past him to the
house.</p>

<p>He followed her for a few steps, then stopped, and with his
head on his breast, went toward the cliffs. His fury had expended
itself, and left a confused, bewildering sensation behind.
For the time it really seemed, as he said, that his baffled love
had turned to hate. But as he thought of her, recalling her
beauty, his hate shrank back and returned to its old object.</p>

<p>"Curse him!" he hissed, "it is he who has done this! If he
had not come to-night this would not have happened. Curse
him! From the first he has stood in my path. Let her go! To
him! Never! No, to-morrow she shall be mine in spite of him,
she cannot draw back, she will not!"</p>

<p>Then his brain cleared; he began to upbraid himself for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
violence. "Fool, fool!" he muttered, hoarsely, as he climbed
the path, scarcely heeding where he went. "I have lost her love
forever! Why did I not bear with her a few hours longer? I
have borne with her so long that I should have borne with her
to the end! It was that cry of hers that maddened me!
Heaven! to think that she should love him so; that she should
have clung to him so persistently, him whom she had not seen
for months, and keep her heart steeled against me who have
hung about her like a slave! But I will be her slave no longer,
to-morrow makes me her master."</p>

<p>As he muttered this sinister threat, he found that he had
reached the end of the cutting that had been made in the cliff,
and turned mechanically. The wind was blowing from the sea,
and the sound of the waves rose from the depths beneath, crying
hoarsely and complainingly as if in harmony with his
mood. He paused a moment and looked down abstractedly.</p>

<p>"I would rather have her lying dead there," he muttered,
"than that there should be a chance of her going back to him.
No! he shall never have her. To-morrow shall set that fear at
rest forever. To-morrow!" With a long breath he turned from
the edge of the cliff, to descend, but as he did so he felt a hand
on his arm, and looking up he saw the thin, frail figure of the
boy standing in the path.</p>

<p>He was so wrapt in his own thoughts that he was startled, and
made a movement to throw the hand off roughly, but it stuck
fast, and with an effort to command himself, he said:</p>

<p>"Well, what are you doing up here?"</p>

<p>As he put the question, he saw by the fading light that the
boy's face was deathly white&mdash;that for once the beautiful, fatal
flush of red was absent.</p>

<p>"You are not fit to be out at this time of night," he said,
harshly. "What are you doing up here?"</p>

<p>The boy looked at him, still retaining his hold, and standing
in his path.</p>

<p>"I have come to speak to you, Jasper," he said, and his thin
voice was strangely set and earnest.</p>

<p>Jasper looked down at him impatiently.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, roughly, "what is it? Couldn't you wait
until I came in."</p>

<p>The boy shook his head.</p>

<p>"No," he said, and there was a strange light in his eyes, which
never for a moment left the other's face. "I wanted to see you
alone."</p>

<p>"Well, I am alone&mdash;or I wish I were," retorted Jasper, brutally.
"What is it?" then he put his hand on the boy's shoulder
and looked at him more closely. "Oh, I see!" he said, with a
sneer. "You've been playing eavesdropper! Well," and he
laughed cruelly, "listeners hear no good of themselves, though
you heard no news."</p>

<p>A slight contraction of the thin lips was the only sign that the
fell shaft had sped home.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, calmly and sternly; "I have been eavesdropping;
I have heard every word, Jasper."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>Jasper nodded.</p>

<p>"Then you can indorse the truth of what I said, my dear
Frank," and he smiled, evilly. "I have no doubt you have not
forgotten your little escapade."</p>

<p>"I have not forgotten," was the response.</p>

<p>"Very good. Then I should advise you, if you care for your
own safety and your cousin's welfare, to say nothing of the
family honor, to advise her to come to terms&mdash;my terms. You
have heard them, no doubt!"</p>

<p>"I have heard about them," said the boy. "I have&mdash;" he
stopped a second to cough, but his hold on Jasper's sleeve did
not relax even during the paroxysm&mdash;"I have heard them. I
know what a devil you are, Jasper Adelstone. I have long
guessed it, but I know now."</p>

<p>Jasper laughed.</p>

<p>"Thanks! and now you have discharged yourself of your
venom, my young asp, we will go down. Take your hand from
my coat, if you please."</p>

<p>"Wait," said the boy, and his voice seemed to have grown
stronger; "I have not done yet. I have followed you here,
Jasper, for a purpose; I have come to ask you for&mdash;for that
paper."</p>

<p>Calmly and dispassionately the request was made, as if it
were the most natural in the world. To say that Jasper was
astonished does not describe his feelings.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;must be mad!" he exclaimed; then he laughed.</p>

<p>"You will not give it to me?" was the quiet demand.</p>

<p>Jasper laughed again.</p>

<p>"Do you know what that precious piece of hand-writing of
yours cost me, my dear Frank? One hundred and fifty pounds
that I shall never see again, unless your friend Holiday takes to
paying his debts."</p>

<p>"I see," said the boy, slowly, and his voice grew reflective;
"you bought it from him? No!"&mdash;with a sudden flash of inspiration&mdash;"he
was a gentleman! By hook or by crook you stole it!"</p>

<p>Jasper nodded.</p>

<p>"Never mind how I got it, I have got it," and he struck his
breast softly.</p>

<p>The sunken eyes followed the gesture, as if they would penetrate
to the hidden paper itself.</p>

<p>"I know," he said, in a low voice; "I saw you put it there."</p>

<p>"And you will not see it again until I hand it to Stella, to-morrow,
or give it to the magistrate before whom you will stand,
my dear lad, charged with forgery."</p>

<p>The word had scarcely left his lips, but the boy was upon him,
his long, thin arms&mdash;endued for a moment, as it seemed, with a
madman's strength&mdash;encircling Jasper's neck. Not a word was
uttered, but the thin, white face, lit up by the gleaming eyes,
spoke volumes.</p>

<p>Jasper was staggered, not frightened, but simply surprised
and infuriated.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you young fool!" he hissed. "Take your arms off
me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>"Give it to me! Give it to me!" panted the boy, in a frenzy.
"Give it to me! The paper! The paper!" and his clutch
tightened like a band of steel.</p>

<p>Jasper smothered an oath. The path was narrow; unconsciously,
or intentionally, the frenzied lad had edged them both,
while talking, to the brink, and Jasper was standing with his
back to it. In an instant he realized his danger; yes, danger!
For, absurd as it seemed, the grasp of the weak, dying boy could
not be shaken off; there was danger.</p>

<p>"Frank!" he cried.</p>

<p>"Give it me!" broke in the wild cry, and he pressed closer.</p>

<p>With an awful imprecation, Jasper seized him and bore him
backward, but as he did so his foot slipped, and the boy, falling
upon him, thrust a hand into Jasper's breast and snatched the
paper.</p>

<p>Jasper was on his feet in a moment, and flying at him tore
the paper from his grasp. The boy uttered a wild cry of despair,
crouched down for a moment, and then with that one wild
prayer upon his lips: "Give it me!" hurled himself upon his
foe. For quite a minute the struggle, so awful in its inequality,
raged between them. His opponent's strength so amazed Jasper
that he was lost to all sense of the place in which they stood; in
his wild effort to shake the boy off he unconsciously approached
the edge of the cliff. Unconsciously on his part, but the other
noticed it, even in his frenzy, and suddenly, as if inspired, he
shrieked out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Look! Leycester! He is there behind you!"</p>

<p>Jasper started and turned his head; the boy seized the moment,
and the next the narrow platform on which they had
stood was empty. A wild hoarse shriek rose up, and mingled
with the dull roar of the waves beneath, and then all was still!</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XL" id="CHAPTER_XL">CHAPTER XL.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Leycester</span> had reached Carlyon on foot. He had left the
house in the morning, simply saying that he was going for a
walk, and that they were not to wait any meal for him. During
the last few days he had wandered in this way, seemingly
desirous of being alone, and showing no inclination toward even
Charlie's society. Lady Wyndward half feared that the old
black fits was coming on him; but Lenore displayed no anxiety;
she even made excuses for him.</p>

<p>"When a man feels the last hour of his liberty approaching,
he naturally likes to use his wings a little," she said, and the
countess had smiled approvingly.</p>

<p>"My dear, you will make a model wife; just the wife that
Leycester needs."</p>

<p>"I think so; I do, indeed," responded Lenore, with her frank,
charming smile.</p>

<p>So Leycester was left alone to his own wild will during those
last few days, while the dressmakers and upholsterers were hard
at work preparing for "the" day.</p>

<p>He could not have told why he came to Carlyon. He did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
even know the name of the little village in which he found himself.
With his handsome face rather grave and weary-looking,
he had tramped into the inn, and sunk down into the seat which
had supported many a generation of Carlyon fisherman and
many sea-coast travelers.</p>

<p>"This is Carlyon, sir," said the landlord, in answer to Leycester's
question, eying the tall figure in its knee breeches and
shooting jacket. "Yes, sir, this is Carlyon; have you come
from St. Michael's, sir?"</p>

<p>Leycester shook his head; he scarcely heard the old man.</p>

<p>"No," he answered; "but I have walked some distance," and
he mentioned the place.</p>

<p>The old man stared.</p>

<p>"Phew! that's a long walk, sir; a main long walk. And what
can I get you to eat, sir?"</p>

<p>Leycester smiled rather wearily. He had heard the question
so often in his travels, and knew the results so perfectly.</p>

<p>"Anything you like," he said.</p>

<p>The landlord nodded in approval at so sensible an answer, and
went out to consult his wife, who had been staring at the handsome
traveler from behind the half-open door of the common
living room. Presently he came out with the result. The gentleman
could have a bit of fish and a chop, and some Falmouth
potatoes.</p>

<p>Leycester nodded indifferently&mdash;anything would do.</p>

<p>Both the fish and the chop were excellent, but Leycester did
anything but justice to them. A strange feeling of restlessness
seemed to have taken possession of him, and when he had lit his
cigar, instead of sitting down and taking it comfortably, he felt
compelled to get up and wander to the door. The evening was
drawing in; there were a fairish number of miles between him
and home&mdash;it was time for him to start, but still he leant against
the door and looked at the sea and cliffs that rose in a line with
the house.</p>

<p>At last he paid his reckoning, supplemented it with a half-crown
for the landlord in his capacity of waiter, and started.
But not homeward; the cliff seemed to exercise a strange fascination
for him, and obeying the impulse which was almost
irresistible, he set off for the path that ascended to the summit,
and strode upward.</p>

<p>A great peace was upon the scene, a great unrest and unsatisfied
desire was in his heart. All the air seemed full of Stella;
her voice mingled, for him, in the plash of the waves. Thinking
of her with a deep, sorrowful wistfulness, he climbed on and&mdash;passed
her.</p>

<p>Stood within reach of her as she cowered and shrank against
the wall of chalk, and all unconscious of her nearness he turned
and came down. The evening had grown chilly and keen, but
his walk had made him hot, and he turned into the inn to get a
glass of ale.</p>

<p>The landlord was surprised to see him again, and said so, and
Leycester stood, with the glass in his hand, explaining that he
had been up the cliff to look at the view.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>"Aye, sir, and a grand view it is," said the old man, with
pardonable pride. "Man and boy I've growed under the shadow
of that cliff, and I know every inch of it, top and bottom.
Mighty dangerous it is too, sir," he added, reflectively. "It's
not one or two, but nigh upon a score o' accidents as I've known
on that cliff."</p>

<p>"The path is none too wide," said Leycester.</p>

<p>"No, sir, and in the dark&mdash;&mdash;" he stopped suddenly, and
started. "What was that?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" Leycester asked.</p>

<p>The old man caught his arm suddenly, and pointed to the
cliff. Leycester looked up, and the glass fell from his hand.
There, on the giddy height, clearly defined against the sky,
were two figures, locked together in what appeared a deadly embrace.</p>

<p>"Look!" exclaimed the old man. "The glass&mdash;give me the
glass!"</p>

<p>Leycester caught up a telescope that stood on a seat beside
them and gave it to him; he himself did not need a glass to see
the dark, struggling figures, they were all too plain. For one
second they stood as if benumbed, and then the echo of the shriek
smote upon their ears, and the cliff was bare. The old man
dropped the telescope and caught Leycester's arm as he made a
bound toward the path.</p>

<p>"No, no, sir!" he exclaimed. "No use to go up there, the
boat! the boat!" and he ran to the beach. Leycester followed
him like a man in a dream, and tearing off his coat, seized an
oar mechanically.</p>

<p>There was not a soul in sight, the peace of the Autumn evening
rested on sea and shore, but in Leycester's ears the echo of
that awful death-shriek rung as plainly as when he had first
heard it. The landlord of the inn, an old sailor, rowed like a
young man, and the boat rose over the waves and cleaved its
way round the bay as if a dozen men were pulling.</p>

<p>Not a word was spoken, the great beads of sweat stood on
their foreheads, their hearts throbbed in unison with every
stroke. Presently Leycester saw the old man relax his stroke
and bend peering over the boat, and suddenly he dropped his
oar and sprang up, pointing to a dark object floating on the top
of the waves. Leycester rose too, calm and acute enough now,
and in another minute Jasper Adelstone was lying at their
feet.</p>

<p>Leycester uttered no cry as his eyes fell upon the pale, set
face, but he sank down in the boat and put his hands to his
eyes.</p>

<p>When he looked up he saw the old man quietly putting his oar
into its place.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," he said, gravely answering Leycester's glance, "he
is dead, stone dead; row back, sir."</p>

<p>"But the other!" said Leycester, in a whisper.</p>

<p>The old man shook his head and glanced upward at the cliff.</p>

<p>"He is up there, sir. Alive or dead, he is up there. He
didn't fall into the sea or we should have met him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then&mdash;then," said Leycester, his voice struggling for calm,
"he may be alive!"</p>

<p>"We shall soon see, sir; row for life or death."</p>

<p>Leycester needed no further prompting, and the boat sped
back. By the time they had gained the shore a crowd had collected,
and Leycester felt, rather than saw, that the motionless,
lifeless form that had haunted him from its place at the bottom
of the boat was carried off&mdash;felt, rather than was conscious, that
he was speeding up the cliff followed by the landlord and half-a-dozen
fishermen.</p>

<p>Silent and breathless they gained the top, and stood for a moment
uncertain; then Leycester saw one of them step forward
with a rope.</p>

<p>"Now, mates," the old man said, "which of us goes down?"</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence, then Leycester stepped forward
and took up the rope.</p>

<p>"I," he said.</p>

<p>It was but a word, but no one ventured to dispute his decision.</p>

<p>Quietly and calmly they fastened the rope round his waist,
leaving a loop lower down. He had left his coat in the boat,
and stood bareheaded for a moment. The old man stood beside
him, calm and grave.</p>

<p>"Hold tight, sir," he said; "and if&mdash;if&mdash;you find him, sling
the rope round him and give the word."</p>

<p>Leycester nodded, held up his hand, and the next moment was
swinging in the air. Slowly and steadily, inch by inch, they
lowered him down the awful depths amidst a death-like silence.
Suddenly his voice broke it, coming up to them in one word&mdash;</p>

<p>"Stop!"</p>

<p>Breathless they waited, then they felt the rope jerk and they
pulled up. A great sob of relief rather than a cheer rose as he
appeared, bearing on his arm the slight figure of poor Frank.</p>

<p>Gently but swiftly they unwound the ropes and laid him down
at Leycester's feet, and the old man knelt beside him.</p>

<p>Leycester did not speak, but stood panting and pale. The old
man looked up.</p>

<p>"Give me a hand, boys," he said, slowly and sternly. "He is
alive!"</p>

<p>"Alive!" said Leycester, hoarsely.</p>

<p>"Alive," repeated the old man. "Yes, sir, you have saved
him, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Leycester followed them down the cliff, followed them to the
inn. Then, as the thin, wasted figure disappeared within the
house, he sank on to the bench at the door, and covered his face
with his hands.</p>

<p>Was it an awful dream?&mdash;would he awake presently and find
himself at home, and this dreadful nightmare vanished?</p>

<p>Suddenly he felt a hand upon his arm, and looking up, saw a
staid, elderly man, with "doctor" written plainly on his face.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, sir," he said. "You know this poor lad?"</p>

<p>Leycester nodded.</p>

<p>"So I understood from a word you let drop on the cliff. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
that is the case, perhaps you would not mind breaking it to his
friends?"</p>

<p>"His friends?" asked Leycester, mechanically.</p>

<p>The doctor nodded.</p>

<p>"They are staying at that cottage," he said, pointing. "They
should be here at once."</p>

<p>Leycester rose, dazed for a moment; then he said, in a low
voice:</p>

<p>"I understand. Yes, I will do it."</p>

<p>Without another word, he strode off. It was no great distance,
but he had not to traverse it, short as it was. At the turn
of the road a slight, girlish figure came flitting toward him. It
was Stella. He stopped irresolute, but at that moment she had
no thought even for him. Without hesitating, she came toward
him, her face pale, her hands outstretched.</p>

<p>"Leycester! where is he?"</p>

<p>Without thinking he put his arm round her and she rested on
his breast for a moment.</p>

<p>"Stella, my Stella! be brave."</p>

<p>She uttered a little inarticulate cry, and hid her face for a
moment, then she raised her head, and looked at him.</p>

<p>"Take me to him!" she moaned, "take me to him. Oh my
poor boy! my poor boy!"</p>

<p>In silence he led her to the inn, and she passed up the stairs.
The fishermen gathered round the door drew back and turned
their eyes from him with respectful sympathy, and he stood
looking out at the sea. The minutes passed, years they seemed
to him, then he heard the doctor's voice.</p>

<p>"Will you go up-stairs, my lord?"</p>

<p>Leycester started, and slowly ascended the stairs.</p>

<p>Stretched on a small bed lay the poor erring boy, white and
death-like, already in the shadow of death. Beside him knelt
Stella, her hand clasping his, her face lying beside his.</p>

<p>He looked up as Leycester entered, and raised a thin white
hand to beckon him near. Instinctively Leycester knelt beside
him.</p>

<p>"You want to see me, Frank?"</p>

<p>The boy raised his eyelids heavily, and seemed to make a great
struggle for strength.</p>

<p>"Leycester," he said, "I&mdash;I have something to give you. You&mdash;you
will understand what it means. It was the charm that
bound her to him. I have broken it&mdash;broken it! It was for my
sake she did it, for mine! I did not know it till to-night. Take
it, Leycester," and slowly he drew from his breast the forged
paper.</p>

<p>Leycester took it, deeming the boy delirious, and Frank seemed
to read his thought.</p>

<p>"You will understand," he panted. "I&mdash;I&mdash;forged it, and he
knew it, and held the knowledge and the paper over her head.
You saved my life, Leycester: I give you something better than
life, Leycester; I give you&mdash;her&mdash;Stella!"</p>

<p>His lips quivered, and he seemed sinking; but he made a
last effort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>"I&mdash;I am dying, Leycester. I am glad, very, very glad. I
don't wish to live. It is better that I should die!"</p>

<p>"Frank!" broke from Stella's white lips.</p>

<p>"Don't cry, Stella. While I lived he&mdash;he would have held you
bound. Now I am dying&mdash;&mdash;" Then his voice failed and his eyes
closed, but they saw his lips move, and Stella, bending over him,
heard the words&mdash;"Forgive, forgive!"</p>

<p>With a loud cry she caught him in her arms, but he had
passed away, even beyond her love, and the next moment she
fell fainting, still holding him to her bosom, as a mother holds
her child.</p>

<p>An hour afterward Leycester was pacing the beach, his
arms folded across his breast, his head bent, a storm of conflicting
emotions raging within. The boy had spoken truly. The
time had come when he understood fully the lad's words.
He had gleaned much from the forged bill, which, all torn and
stained, lay hidden in his pocket; but the full meaning of the
mystery had been conveyed to him by the delirious words of
Stella, who lay in a high fever.</p>

<p>He had just left her, and was now waiting for the doctor,
waiting for his verdict&mdash;life or death. Life or death! He had
often heard, often used the words, but never until this moment
knew their import.</p>

<p>Presently the doctor joined him, and Leycester uttered the one
word:</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"She will live," he said.</p>

<p>Leycester raised his head and drew a long breath. The doctor
continued:</p>

<p>"Yes, I think I may say she will pull through. I shall know
more to-morrow. You see, she has undergone a severe strain; I
do not allude to the tragic incidents of the evening; those in
themselves are sufficient to try a young girl; but she has been
laboring under extreme nervous pressure for months past."</p>

<p>Leycester groaned.</p>

<p>"Come, come, my lord," said the doctor, cheerfully. "You
may depend upon me. I should not hold out hope unless I had
good reason for so doing. We shall save her, I trust and believe."</p>

<p>Leycester inclined his head; he could not speak. The doctor
looked at him gravely.</p>

<p>"If you will permit me, my lord," he said, "I would suggest
that you should now take some rest. You are far from strong
yourself."</p>

<p>Leycester smiled grimly.</p>

<p>"Far from strong," repeated the doctor, emphatically. "And
there is a great deal more endurance before you. Be advised and
take some rest, my lord.</p>

<p>"The landlord has been speaking to me, sir, about the unfortunate
man you found. It seems that there are papers and
valuables&mdash;jewelry, and such like. Will your lordship take
charge of them until the police arrive? I understand that you
knew him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I knew him," said Leycester. He had, in truth, almost
forgotten Jasper Adelstone. "I will take charge of the things,
if you wish it."</p>

<p>"Follow me, then," said the doctor.</p>

<p>They went to the inn, and up the stairs, with that quiet, subdued
step with which men approach the presence of grim death,
and stood beside the bed upon which lay all that remained of the
man who had so nearly wrecked two lives.</p>

<p>Leycester looked down at the white face, calm and expressionless&mdash;looked
down with a solemn feeling at his heart, and the
doctor drew some papers from the coat.</p>

<p>"These are them," he said, "if your lordship will take charge
of them."</p>

<p>Leycester took them, and as he did so, he glanced mechanically
at them as they lay in his hand, and uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>There in his hand lay the note which Lenore had written, bidding
Jasper Adelstone meet her in the wood. He knew the
writing in a moment, and before he had time to prevent it, had
read the few pregnant words.</p>

<p>The doctor turned round.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?"</p>

<p>Leycester stood, and for the first time that awful night trembled.
The idea of treachery and deceit so connected with Lenore
utterly unnerved him. He knew, he felt as if by instinct, that
he held in his hand a link in the chain of cunning and chicanery
which had so nearly entangled him, and the thought that her
name would become the prey of the newspapers was torture.</p>

<p>"Doctor," he said, and his voice trembled, "I have seen by
accident a letter written to this unfortunate man. It consists of
a few lines only. It will compromise a lady whose good name
is in my keeping&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The doctor held up his hand.</p>

<p>"Your lordship will be guided by your sense of honor," he
said.</p>

<p>Leycester inclined his head and put the note in his pocket.</p>

<p>Then they went down, and the doctor strode off to the cottage
and left Leycester still pacing the beach.</p>

<p>Yes, the boy had spoken truly. He saw it all now. He knew
how it had been brought to pass that Stella had been entrapped
into Jasper's chambers; he saw the unscrupulous hand of a
woman weaving the threads of the net in which they had been
entangled. Minute details were not necessary, that little note
in the dainty hand-writing told its own story; Jasper Adelstone
and Lady Lenore Beauchamp had been in league together;
death had squared the reckoning between him and the man, but
he had still to settle the tragic account with the woman.</p>

<p>The night passed, and the dawn broke, and the little doctor
returning, weary and exhausted, found the tall figure still pacing
the beach.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XLI" id="CHAPTER_XLI">CHAPTER XLI.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Lenore</span> sat in her dainty room, her long golden hair flooding
her white shoulders, her fair face reflected in the Venetian
mirror with its edging of antique work and trimming of lace.
Not even a Venetian mirror could have desired to hold a fairer
picture; youth, beauty, and happiness, smiled from its surface.
The rich, delicately curved lips smiled to-night, with an ineffable
content, and serene satisfaction.</p>

<p>There was a latent gleam of triumph in the violet eyes, eloquent
of triumph and victory. She had conquered; the desire
of her life was nearly within her grasp; two days&mdash;forty-eight
hours&mdash;more and Leycester Wyndward would be hers. An
ancient name, an historic title, an immense estate were to be
hers. To do her justice at this moment, she thought neither of
the title nor the estate; it was of the man, of the man with his
handsome face, and musical voice, and <i>debonnaire</i> manner that
she thought. If they had come and told her, there where she
sat, that it had been discovered that he was neither noble nor
rich, she would not have cared, it would not have mattered. It
was the man, it was Leycester himself, for whom she had
plotted and schemed, and she would have been content with him
alone.</p>

<p>Even now, as she looked at the beautiful reflection in the
mirror, it was with no thought of her own beauty, all her
thoughts were of him; and the smile that crossed the red lips
was called up by no spirit of vanity, but by the thought that in
forty-eight hours, the wish and the desire of her life would be
gratified.</p>

<p>In silence the maid brushed out the wealth of golden tresses,
of which she was almost as proud as the owner herself; she had
heard a whisper in the servants' hall, but it was not for her to
speak. It was a rumor that something had happened to Lord
Leycester, that he had not returned yet, and that one of the
wild fits, with which all the household were familiar, had seized
him, and that he was off no one knew where.</p>

<p>It was not for her to speak, but she watched her beautiful mistress
covertly, and thought how quickly she could dispel the
smile of serenity which sat upon the fair face.</p>

<p>Quiet as the wedding was intended to be, there was necessarily
some stir; the society papers had got hold of it, and dilated
upon it in paragraphs, in which Lenore was spoken of as "our
reigning beauty," and Leycester described as the son of a well-known
peer, and a man of fashion. Quite an army of upholsterers
had been at work at the house in Grosvenor Square,
and another army of milliners and dressmakers had been preparing
the bride's <i>trousseau</i>. A pile of imperials and portmanteaus
stood in the dressing-room, each bearing the initials
"I," with the coronet.</p>

<p>One or two of the Beauchamps, the present earl and a brother&mdash;together
with three young lady cousins, who were to act as
bridesmaids&mdash;had been invited, and were to arrive the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
evening. Certainly there must be some slight fuss, and Lenore,
as she thought of Leycester's absence, ascribed it to his
dislike to the aforesaid fuss, and his desire to escape from it.</p>

<p>The maid went at last, and Lenore, with a happy sigh, went
to sleep. At that time Leycester was pacing the beach at Carlyon,
and Jasper and poor Frank were lying dead. Surely if
dreams come to warn one of impending trouble, Lady Lenore
should have dreamed to-night; but she did not. She
slept the night through without a break, and rose fresh and
beautiful, with only twenty-four hours between her and happiness.</p>

<p>But when she entered the breakfast-room, and met the pale,
anxious face of the countess, and the grave one of the earl, a
sudden spasm of fear, scarcely fear, but apprehension, fell upon
her.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" she asked, gliding to the countess, and
kissing her.</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;really nothing, dear," she said, attempting to
speak lightly.</p>

<p>"Where is Leycester?" she asked.</p>

<p>"That is it," replied the countess, pouring out the coffee, and
keeping her eye fixed on the cup. "The foolish boy hasn't returned
yet."</p>

<p>"Not returned?" echoed Lenore, and a faint flush came into
her face. "Where did he go?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, my dear Lenore, and I cannot find out. He
didn't tell you?"</p>

<p>Lenore shook her head, and fastened a flower in her dress with
a hand that quivered faintly.</p>

<p>"No. I did not ask him. I saw him go."</p>

<p>"Was he on foot, or riding?" asked the earl.</p>

<p>"On foot," said Lenore. "He was in his shooting clothes,
and I thought he was going for a walk on the hills."</p>

<p>The earl broke his piece of toast with a little irritable jerk.</p>

<p>"It is annoying," he said. "It is extremely inconsiderate of
him, extremely. To-day, of all others, he should have remained
at home."</p>

<p>"He will be here presently," said Lenore, calmly.</p>

<p>The countess sighed.</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;of course nothing could have happened to him."</p>

<p>She merely made the suggestion in a suppressed, hushed,
anxious voice.</p>

<p>Lenore laughed&mdash;actually laughed.</p>

<p>"Happened to him, to Leycester!" she said, with proud contempt.
"What could have happened to him? Leycester is not
the sort of man to meet with accidents. Pray do not be uneasy,
dear; he will come in directly, very tired, and very hungry,
and laugh at us."</p>

<p>"I give him credit for better manners," said the earl, curtly.</p>

<p>He was angry and annoyed. As he had said to the countess
before Lenore came in, he had hoped and believed that Leycester
had given up this sort of boyish nonsense, and intended to
act sensibly, as became a man who had settled to marry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a moment's pause while the earl buttered his toast,
still irritably; then Lady Wyndward said almost to herself&mdash;</p>

<p>"Perhaps Lilian knows?"</p>

<p>"No," said Lenore, quickly, "she does not, or she would have
told me. I saw her last night the last thing, and she did not
know he was out. Do not tell her."</p>

<p>The countess glanced at her gratefully.</p>

<p>"She would only be anxious and fret," said Lenore. "While
I am not, and shall not be," she added, with a smile. "I am
not afraid that Leycester has run away from me."</p>

<p>She looked up as she spoke, and flashed her beauty upon
them, as it were, and smiled, and the mother felt reassured.
Certainly it did not seem probable that any man would run
away from her.</p>

<p>She herself felt no fear, not even when the morning grew to
noon and the noon to evening. She went about the house superintending
the packing of the multitudinous things, arranging
the epergnes, playing the piano even, and more than once the
light air from the French opera floated through the room.</p>

<p>Lord Beauchamp and the rest of the visitors were to arrive
about seven, just in time to dress for dinner, and the stir that
had reigned in the house grew accentuated as the time approached.
Lenore went to her room at six to dress; she meant
to look her best to-night, as well indeed as she meant to look on
the following day; and her maid knew by the attention which
her mistress had paid to the wardrobe that every care would be
expected from her ministering hands. Just before she went to
her room she met the countess on the stairs; they had not seen
very much of each other during the day; there was a great deal
to do, and the countess, notwithstanding her rank, was a housekeeper
in something more than name.</p>

<p>"Lenore," she said, then stopped.</p>

<p>The beauty bent over from her position on a higher step and
kissed her.</p>

<p>"I know, dear&mdash;he has not come yet. Well, he will be here
by dinner-time. Why are you so anxious? I am not."</p>

<p>And she laughed.</p>

<p>It certainly encouraged the countess, and she even called up
a smile.</p>

<p>"What a strange girl you are, Lenore," she said. "One would
have thought that you, before all of us, would have been uneasy."</p>

<p>Lenore shook her head.</p>

<p>"No, dear; I feel&mdash;I feel that he will come. Now see if my
prophecy comes true."</p>

<p>And she went up the stairs, casting a serene and confident
smile over her shoulder.</p>

<p>"I will wear that last blue dress of Worth's, and the pearls,"
she said to her maid, and the girl started. The dress had just
arrived, and was supposed to be reserved for future London
triumphs.</p>

<p>"The last, my lady?"</p>

<p>Lenore nodded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; I want to look my best to-night; and if I were not
afraid of being thought too pronounced, I would wear my diamonds."</p>

<p>The girl arranged the beautiful hair in its close curls of gold,
and fastened the famous pearls upon the white wrists and round
the dainty throat; and Lenore surveyed herself in the Venetian
mirror. A smile of satisfaction slowly lit up her face.</p>

<p>"Well?" she said, over her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Beautiful," breathed the girl, who was proud of her mistress's
loveliness. "Oh, beautiful, my lady! but isn't it a pity to wear
it to-night?"</p>

<p>Lenore shook her head.</p>

<p>"I would wear a better if I had it," she said, softly. "Now go
down-stairs, and tell me when Lord Leycester returns."</p>

<p>The girl stared and then smiled. After all then they had been
worrying themselves about nothing; her ladyship had received a
message from him and knew when to expect him! She went down
and crowed over them in the servants' hall, and watched for Lord
Leycester.</p>

<p>Seven o'clock chimed from the stables, and the carriage that had
been sent to meet the guests returned. Lord Beauchamp was a tall,
stately old gentleman who hated traveling as he hated anything
else that gave him any trouble or inconvenience, and the rest
were tired and dusty, and generally pining for soap and water.
The earl and countess met them in the hall, and in the bustle and
fuss Leycester was not missed.</p>

<p>"Do not hurry, Lord Beauchamp," said the poor countess. "We
will make the dinner half-past eight," and she wished in her
heart that she could postpone it altogether; for Leycester had not
come.</p>

<p>"What shall we do&mdash;what shall we do?" she exclaimed, as the
earl stood at her dressing-room door with his coat in his
hand.</p>

<p>"Do!" he retorted. "Go on without him. This comes of humoring
an only son till he develops into a lunatic. Poor Lenore! I
pity her!" and he went out frowning.</p>

<p>"He has not come, my lady!" murmured the maid, entering Lenore's
room a few minutes afterwards. "Lord Beauchamp's party
have arrived, but Lord Leycester has not come."</p>

<p>Lenore was standing by the open window, and she turned with a
sudden smile. The sound of horse's feet had struck upon her
ear.</p>

<p>"Yes, he has," she said. "He is here now," and she closed the
window and sat down calmly.</p>

<p>Leycester rode into the courtyard on the horse that he had
borrowed from the doctor, and, throwing the bridle to a groom, ascended
the stone steps and made his way through the hall.</p>

<p>Excepting some of the servants, there was no one about, they
had all gone to their dressing-rooms, and he went up the stairs
in silence and uninterrupted. With bent head and dragging step,
for the long vigil and hours of excitement had told upon him,
he stood before Lilian's room. It was worthy of notice that in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
this awful coming back of his he went to her first, as a matter
of course, and knocking gently, went in.</p>

<p>It was dark, and the lamp was burning softly, but she, accustomed
to the dim light, saw plainly that something had happened.</p>

<p>"Leycester!" she exclaimed. "Why&mdash;how is this, dear?
Where have you been all day and all last night? You did not
come to me and&mdash;&mdash;" she stopped as he sat down beside her and
put his hand upon her head. The hand was burning hot, his
face was white and haggard and worn, and yet in some way
strangely peaceful, with a far-away, dreamy expression upon it&mdash;"Leycester,
where have you been?"</p>

<p>He bent and kissed her.</p>

<p>"Lil," he said, and there was a great peace in his voice though
it was weary and husky, "you will be a brave good girl while I
tell you!"</p>

<p>"Ah, Leycester!" was all she murmured.</p>

<p>"Well, Lil, I have found her&mdash;I have got her back&mdash;my poor
Stella."</p>

<p>Her hand closed on his, and her delicate face went white as
ivory.</p>

<p>"Got her back!"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, in low tones. "I have found out the mystery&mdash;no,
not I. It was solved for me by a mightier hand than any
human one&mdash;by Death, Lil."</p>

<p>"Death, Leycester! She is not dead! Oh, Stella&mdash;Stella!"</p>

<p>"Heaven forbid," he breathed. "No, no; she is alive, though
fearfully near death still. I left her lying white and still and
weak as a broken lily&mdash;my poor, sweet darling!&mdash;but she is
alive, thank Heaven!&mdash;she is alive! And now can you bear to
hear what separated us, Lil?"</p>

<p>"Tell me," she said.</p>

<p>Sitting there, with her loving, sympathizing heart beating
against his, he told her the strange story. Sobs, low and moving,
broke from her as he told of the boy's death, and an awful
chill fell on her as he spoke as shortly as he could of the fate
that had befallen Jasper Adelstone; but when he came to speak
of that short damning note that he had found&mdash;that note in the
hand-writing of Lenore, and hinted at her share in the conspiracy&mdash;the
gentle heart grew cold and terrified, and she hid her face
for a moment, then she looked up and clasped her hands round
his neck.</p>

<p>"Oh, Ley, Ley! deal gently with her! Forgive her! We all
need forgiveness! Forgive her; she did it out of her love for
you, and has suffered, and will suffer! Deal gently with her!"</p>

<p>He bit his lip, and his brow darkened.</p>

<p>"Ley, Ley!" the gentle creature pleaded, "think of her now
waiting for you, think of her who was to be your wife. She
loved you. Ley, she loves you still; and that will be her punishment!
Ley, you will not be hard with her!"</p>

<p>Her prayer prevailed; he drew a long breath.</p>

<p>"No, Lil," he said, in a low voice, "I will not be hard with
her. But as for love! True love does not stand by and see its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
beloved suffer as I have suffered; not true love. There is a passion
which men libel by calling love&mdash;that is what she has borne
for me. Love! Think of her? Yes; I will think of her; but
how am I to forget my beautiful, suffering darling, lying so
white and wan and broken," and he hid his face in his hands.
Presently he rose and kissed her.</p>

<p>"I am going to her," he said. "Do not fear! I have given
you my word; I will deal gently with her."</p>

<p>She let him go without another word, and he went straight to
Lenore's sitting-room, travel-stained and haggard, and unrefreshed.</p>

<p>The maid heard his knock, and opened the door, and passed
out as he entered and stood in the middle of the room. There
was a faint rustle in the adjoining room, and then she came
floating toward him in all her loveliness, the faint, ethereal blue
making her white skin to shame the rare and costly pearls. She
was dazzling in her supreme loveliness, and at any other time
he would have been moved, but now it was as if a deadly, venomous
serpent, glorious in its scaly beauty, lay coiled before him.</p>

<p>She came forward, her hands outstretched, her eyes glowing
with a passionate welcome, and then stopped. Not a word passed
for a moment; the two, she in all her costly attire and loveliness,
he in his stained cord suit and with his haggard face, confronted
each other. She read her doom at a glance, but the proud,
haughty spirit did not quail.</p>

<p>"Well?" she said at last.</p>

<p>Chivalrous to the last, even in this moment, he pointed to a
seat, but she made a gesture of refusal and stood, her white
hands clasped tightly, her head erect, her eyes glowing. "Well?
You have come back?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have come back, Lady Lenore," he said, his voice dry
and hoarse.</p>

<p>She smiled bitterly at the "lady."</p>

<p>"You are late," she said. "Was it worth while coming back?"</p>

<p>It was a proud and insolent question, but he bore with her.</p>

<p>"I came back for your sake," he said.</p>

<p>"For mine!" and she smiled incredulously. She could smile
still, though an icy hand was closing round her heart, and
wringing the life blood out of it.</p>

<p>"For yours. It was not fitting that you should hear from
other lips than mine that from this hour you and I are as far
apart as pole from pole."</p>

<p>She inclined her head.</p>

<p>"So be it. There is no appeal from such a sentence. But
may I ask you to explain; dare I venture so far?" and her lip
curled.</p>

<p>"Do you think you dare?" he said, sternly.</p>

<p>She inclined her head, his sternness struck her like a blow.</p>

<p>"You have come to tell me, have you not?" she said. "Where
have you been?"</p>

<p>"I have come from Carlyon," he said.</p>

<p>"From whom?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>"From the girl from whom your base scheming separated me,"
he said, sternly.</p>

<p>"Ah," she breathed, but her eyes opened with a wild stare.
"You&mdash;you have gone back to her?"</p>

<p>He waved his hand.</p>

<p>"Let there be no word of her between us," he said; "your lips
shall not profane her name."</p>

<p>She turned white and her hand went to her heart.</p>

<p>"Forgive me," he said, hoarsely. Had he not promised to
deal gently with her? "I have not come to utter reproaches&mdash;I
came to shield you, if that were possible."</p>

<p>"To shield!&mdash;from what?" she demanded, in a low murmur.</p>

<p>"From the consequences of your crime," he said. "What
that is, I have only learnt to-night; but for a chance accident the
world would know to-morrow that Lady Lenore Beauchamp
had stooped so low as to become the accomplice of Jasper Adelstone
in a vile conspiracy."</p>

<p>She waved her hand.</p>

<p>"He dare not speak. I defy him!"</p>

<p>Leycester held up his hand.</p>

<p>"He is beyond your defiance," he said&mdash;"Jasper Adelstone is
dead!"</p>

<p>She made a gesture of contemptuous indifference.</p>

<p>"What is that to me?" she said, hoarsely. "Why do you
speak to me of him or any other man? Is it not enough that I
have failed? Have you come to gloat over me? What is it that
you want?"</p>

<p>He thrust his hand in his breast, and drew forth the note.</p>

<p>"I have come to restore this to you," he said. "I took it
from the dead man's bosom&mdash;took it to save your reputation.
The story it told me I have heard in fact from the lips of the
girl you have plotted against and wronged. It is at her bidding
that I am here&mdash;here to save you from scandal, and to cover if
possible your retreat."</p>

<p>"At her's&mdash;at Stella Etheridge's?" she breathed, as though
the name would choke her.</p>

<p>He waved his hand.</p>

<p>"You will leave this house to-night. I have made all arrangements
necessary, and you will start in an hour's time."</p>

<p>She laughed discordantly.</p>

<p>"And if I say I will not?"</p>

<p>He looked at her sternly.</p>

<p>"Then I will tell the story to my mother and you shall hear
your dismissal from her lips. Choose!"</p>

<p>She dropped into a chair, and made a gesture of scorn.</p>

<p>"Tell whom you please," she said. "I am your affianced
wife, my people are under your roof at this moment; go to them
and tell them that you have deserted me for a low-born girl!"</p>

<p>He turned and strode to the door; but ere he had reached it the
reaction had come. With a low cry, she flew to him and sank
at his feet, her hands clasped on his arm, her face upturned with
an awful imploration.</p>

<p>"Leycester, Leycester! Do not leave me! Do not go! Leycester,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
I was wrong, wicked, base, vile; but it was all for you&mdash;for
you! Leycester, listen to me! You will not go! Do not
fling me from you! Look at me, Leycester!"</p>

<p>He did look at her, lovely in her abandon and despair, and
then averted his eyes; it horrified him to see her so low and degraded.</p>

<p>"You will not look at me!" she wailed; "you will not! Oh,
Heaven! am I so changed? am I old, ugly, hideous? Leycester,
you have called me beautiful a hundred&mdash;a thousand times;
and now you will not look at me! You will leave me! You
shall not; I will hold you like this forever&mdash;forever! Ah!"&mdash;for
he had made a movement to disengage himself&mdash;"you will
not hurt me! Yes; kill me, kill me here at your feet! I would
rather die so than live without you. I cannot, Leycester! Listen,
I love you; I love you twenty thousand times better than
that wretched girl can do! Leycester, I will give my life for
you! See, I am kneeling here at your feet! You will not spurn
me, you cannot repel me! Leycester! oh, my darling, my love!
do what you will with me, but do not spurn me! Oh, my love,
my love!"</p>

<p>It was piteous, it was awful, to see and hear her, and the
strong man trembled and turned pale, but his heart was stone
and ice toward her; the white, wan face of his darling came between
them, and made the flushed, passion-distorted face at his
feet seem hideous and repellant.</p>

<p>"Rise!" he said, sternly.</p>

<p>"No, no; I will not," she moaned. "I will die at your feet!
Leycester, you will kill me! I have lost all for your sake, pride
and honor, and now my fair name, for you cannot shield me;
and you will thrust me aside. Leycester, you cannot! you cannot!
Oh, my love, my love, do not spurn me from you!" and
still on her knees, she bent her head upon his arm, and poured a
storm of passionate, broken kisses upon his hand.</p>

<p>That roused him. With an exclamation of abhorrence, he
threw her grasp off, and stood with his hand on the door.</p>

<p>She sprang to her feet, and, white and breathless, looked at
him as if she would read his soul; then throwing her hands
above her head, she fell to the ground.</p>

<p>He stood for a moment or two bending over her, thinking her
senseless, but it was simply mental and physical exhaustion, and
when he strode to the bell, she opened her eyes and held up
her hand to stop him.</p>

<p>"No," she murmured. "Let no one see me. Go now. Go!"</p>

<p>He went to the door, and she rose and supported herself
against a chair.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Leycester," she said. "I have lost you&mdash;and all!
All!"</p>

<p>It was the last words he heard her utter for many and many a
year.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XLII" id="CHAPTER_XLII">CHAPTER XLII.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">"After</span> all, there is nothing like English scenery; this is very
beautiful. I don't suppose you could get a greater variety of
opal tints in one view than lies before us now, but there is something
missing. It is all too beautiful, too rich, too gorgeous;
one finds one's breath coming too quickly, and one longs for
just a dash of English gloom to tone down the brilliant colors
and give a relief."</p>

<p>It was Mr. Etheridge who spoke. He was standing beside a
low rustic seat which fronted the world-famous view from the
Piazza at Nice. The sun was dropping into the horizon like a
huge ball of crimson fire, the opal tints of the sky stretched far
above their heads and even behind them. It was one blaze of
glory in which a slim, girlish figure, leaning far back in the
seat, seemed bathed.</p>

<p>She was pale still, was this Stella, this little girl heroine of
ours, but the dark look of trouble and leaden sorrow had gone,
and the light of youth and youthful joy had come back to the
dark eyes; the faint, ever ready smile hovered again about the
red, mobile lips. "Sorrow" says Goethe, "is the refining touch
to a woman's beauty," and it refined Stella's. She was lovely
now, with that soft, ethereal loveliness which poets sing of,
and artists paint, and we poor penman so vainly strive to
describe.</p>

<p>She looked up with a smile.</p>

<p>"Homesick, uncle?" she murmurs.</p>

<p>The old man strokes his beard, and glances at her.</p>

<p>"I plead guilty," he says. "You cannot make a hermit crab
happy if you take him out of his shell, and the cottage is my
shell, Stella."</p>

<p>She sighed softly, not with unhappiness, but with that tender
reflectiveness which women alone possess.</p>

<p>"I will go back when you please, dear," she says.</p>

<p>"Hem!" he grunts. "There is someone else to consult, mademoiselle;
that someone else seems particularly satisfied to remain
where we are; but then I suppose he would be contented to
remain anywhere so that a certain pale-faced, insignificant chit
of a girl were near him."</p>

<p>A faint blush, a happy flush spreads over the pale face, and
the long lashes droop over the dark eyes.</p>

<p>"At any rate we must ask him," says the old man; "we owe
him that little attention at least, seeing how much long-suffering
patience he has and continues to display."</p>

<p>"Don't, uncle," murmurs the half-parted lips.</p>

<p>"It is all very well to say 'don't,'" retorts the old man
with a grim smile. "Seriously, don't you think that you
are, to use an Americanism, playing it rather low down on the
poor fellow?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;don't know what you mean," she falters.</p>

<p>"Permit me to explain then," he says, ironically.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't want to hear, dear."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is fitting that girls should be made to hear sometimes," he
says, with a smile. "What I mean is simply this, that, as a
man with something approaching a conscience and a fellow
feeling for my kind, I feel it my duty to point out to you that,
perhaps unconsciously, you are leading Leycester the sort of life
that the bear who dances on hot bricks&mdash;if any bear ever does&mdash;is
supposed to lead. Here for months, after no end of suffering&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have suffered too," she murmurs.</p>

<p>"Exactly," he assents, in his gently-grim way; "but that
only makes it worse. After months of suffering, you allow him
to dangle at your heels, you drag him at your chariot wheels,
tied him at your apron strings from France to Italy, from Italy
to Switzerland, from Switzerland back to France again, and gave
him no more encouragement than a cat does a dog."</p>

<p>The faint flush is a burning crimson now.</p>

<p>"He&mdash;he need not come," she murmurs, panting. "He is
not obliged."</p>

<p>"The moth&mdash;the infuriated moth, is not obliged to hover about
the candle, but he does hover, and generally winds up by
scorching his wings. I admit that it is foolish and unreasonable,
but it is none the less true that Leycester is simply incapable,
apparently, of resting outside the radius of your presence, and
therefore I say hadn't you better give him the right to remain
within that radius and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She put up her hand to stop him, her face a deeper crimson
still.</p>

<p>"Permit me," he says, obstinately, and puffing at his pipe to
emphasize. "Once more the unfortunate wretch is on tenterhooks;
he is dying to take possession of you, and afraid to speak
up like a man because, possibly, you have had a little illness&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, uncle, and you said yourself that you thought I should
have died."</p>

<p>He coughs.</p>

<p>"Ahem! One is inclined to exaggerate sometimes. He is
afraid to speak because in his utter sensitiveness he will insist
upon considering you an invalid still, whereas you are about as
strong and healthy now as, to use another Americanism, 'they
make 'em.' Now, Stella, if you mean to marry him, say so; if
you don't mean to, say so, and for goodness sake let the unfortunate
monomaniac go."</p>

<p>"Leycester is not a monomaniac, uncle," she retorts, in a low,
indignant voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, he is," he says, "he is possessed by a mania for a little
chit of a girl with a pale face and dark eyes and a nose that is
nothing to speak of. If he wasn't an utterly lost maniac he
would have refused to dangle at your heels any longer, and gone
off to someone with some pretension to a regular facial outline."
He stops, for there comes the sound of a firm, manly tread upon
the smooth gravel path, and the next instant Leycester's tall
figure is beside them.</p>

<p>He bends over the slight, slim, graceful figure, a loving, reverential
devotion in his handsome face, a faint anxiety in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
eyes and in his voice as he says, in that low, musical undertone
which has charmed so many women's ears:</p>

<p>"Have you no wrap on, Stella? These evenings are very
beautiful but treacherous."</p>

<p>"There isn't a breath of air," says Stella, with a little laugh.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" he says, and puts his hand on the arm that rests
on the seat, "you must be careful, indeed you must, my darling,
I will go and get you a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Blanket and a suit of sables," broke in the old man, with
good humorous banter. "Allow me, I am young and full of
energy, and you are old and wasted and wearied, watching over
a sick and perhaps dying girl, who eats three huge meals a day,
and can outwalk Weston. I will go," and he goes and leaves
them, Stella's soft laughter following him like music.</p>

<p>Leycester stands beside her looking down at her in silence.
For him that rustic seat holds all that is good and worth having
in life, and as he looks, the passionate love that burns so steadily
in his heart glows in his eyes.</p>

<p>For weeks, for months he has watched her&mdash;watched her patiently
as now&mdash;watched her from the shadow of death, into
the world of life; and though his eyes and the tone of his voice
have spoken love often and often, he has so tutored his lips as to
refrain from open speech. He knows the full measure of the
shock which had struck her down, and in his great reverence
and unfathomable love for her, he has restrained himself, fearing
that a word might bring back that terrible past. But now,
to-night, as he sees the faint color tinting the clear cheeks&mdash;sees
the sunset light reflected in her bright eyes&mdash;his heart begins to
beat with that throb which tells of long-suppressed passion
clamoring for expression.</p>

<p>Maiden-like, she feels something of what is passing through
his mind, and a great shyness falls upon her. She can almost
hear her heart beat.</p>

<p>"Won't you sit down?" she says, at last, in that little, low,
murmuring voice, which is such sweet music in his ears. And
she moves her dress to make room for him.</p>

<p>He comes round, and sinks in the seat beside her.</p>

<p>"Can you not feel the breeze now?" he asks. "I wish I had
brought a wrap with me, on the chance of your having forgotten
it."</p>

<p>She looks round at him, with laughter in her eyes and on her
lips.</p>

<p>"Did you not hear what uncle said?" She asks. "Don't you
know that he was laughing, actually laughing at me? When
will you <i>begin</i> to believe that I am well and strong and ridiculously
robust? Don't you see that the people at the hotel are
quite amused with your solicitude respecting my delicate state
of health?"</p>

<p>"I don't care anything about the people at the hotel," he says,
in that frank, simple way which speaks so plainly of his love.
"I know that I don't mean you to catch cold if I can help it!"</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you are very good to me," she says, and there is a
slight tremor in her voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>He laughs his old short, curt laugh, softened in a singular
way.</p>

<p>"Am I? You might say that a man was particularly 'good'
because he showed some concern for the safety of a particularly
precious stone!"</p>

<p>Her eyes droop, and, perhaps unconsciously, her arm draws a
little nearer to him.</p>

<p>"You are good," she says, "but I am not a precious stone,
by any means."</p>

<p>"You are all that is rare and precious to me, my darling," he
says; "you are all the world to me. Stella!&mdash;--" he stops,
alarmed lest he should be alarming her, but his arm slides round
her, and he ventures to draw her nearer to him.</p>

<p>It is the only embrace he has ventured to give her since
that night when she fell into his arms at the cottage door at
Carlyon, and he half fears that she will shrink from him in
the new strange shyness that has fallen upon her; but she
does not, instead she lets her head droop until it rests upon
his breast, and the strong man's passion leaps full force and
masterful in a moment.</p>

<p>"Stella!" he murmurs, his lips pressed to hers, which do
not swerve, "may I speak? Will you let me? You will not
be angry?"</p>

<p>She does not look angry; her eyes fixed on his have nothing
but submissive love in them.</p>

<p>"I have waited,&mdash;it seems so long&mdash;because I was afraid
to trouble you, but I may speak now, Stella?" and he draws
her closer to him. "Will you be my wife&mdash;soon&mdash;soon?"</p>

<p>He waits, his handsome face eloquent in its entreaty and
anxiety, and she leans back and looks up at him, then her
gaze falters. A little quiver hovers on her lips, and the dark
eyes droop.</p>

<p>Is it "Yes"? If so, he alone could have heard it.</p>

<p>"My poor darling!" he murmurs, and he takes her face in his
hands and turns it up to him. "Oh, my darling, If you knew
how I loved you&mdash;how anxiously I have waited! And it shall
be soon, Stella! My little wife! My very own!"</p>

<p>"Yes!" she said, and, as in the old time, she raises herself in
his arms and kisses him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"And&mdash;and the countess, and all of them!" she murmurs, but
with a little quaint smile.</p>

<p>He smiles calmly. "Not to-night, darling, do not let us talk
of the outside world to-night. But see if 'all of them,' as you
put it, are not exactly of one mind; one of them is," and he
takes out a letter from his pocket.</p>

<p>"From Lilian!" she says, guessing instinctively.</p>

<p>Leycester nods.</p>

<p>"Yes, take it and read; you will find your name in every
line. Stella, it was this letter that gave me courage to speak to
you to-night. A woman knows a woman after all&mdash;you will
read what she says. 'Are you still afraid, Ley,' she writes, 'ask
her!' and I have asked. And now all the past will be buried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
and we shall be happy at last. At last, Stella, where&mdash;where
shall it be?"</p>

<p>She is silent, but she lifts the letter to her lips and kisses it.</p>

<p>"What do you say to Paris?" he asks.</p>

<p>"Paris!" she echoes, flushing.</p>

<p>"Yes," he says, "I have been talking to the old doctor, and
he thinks you are strong enough to have a little excitement
now, and thinks that a tour in Paris would be the very thing to
complete things. What do you say," he goes on, trying to speak
in a matter-of-fact voice, but watching her with eager eyes, "if
we start at the end of the week, that will give you time to make
your preparations, won't it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Then say the beginning of next," he returns, magnanimously,
"and we will be married about Wednesday"&mdash;she
utters a faint exclamation, and turns pale and red by turns, but
he is steadfast&mdash;"and then we can have a gay time of it before
we settle down."</p>

<p>"Settle down," she says, with a little longing sigh. "How
sweet it sounds&mdash;but next week!"</p>

<p>"It is a cruel time to wait," he declares, drawing her nearer
to him, "cruel&mdash;next week! It is months, years, ages&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush!" she says, struggling gently away from him, "here is
uncle."</p>

<p>It is uncle, but he is innocent of wraps.</p>

<p>"Going to stay out all night?" he asks, with fine irony.</p>

<p>"Why, where are the wraps?" demands Leycester.</p>

<p>"Eh? Oh, nonsense!" says the old man. "Do you want to
commit suicide together by suffocation? It's as warm as an
oven. Oh, for my little garden, and the cool room."</p>

<p>"You shall have it in a week or two," says Leycester, with a
smile of ineffable satisfaction. "We are going to take you to
Paris, and then will come and stay with you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, will you? and who asked you, Mr. Jackanapes?"</p>

<p>"Why, you wouldn't refuse shelter to your niece's husband?"
retorts Leycester, laughing.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's it!" says the old man. "Allow me to wish you
good-night. I'll leave you to your Midsummer madness&mdash;no,
to your Autumn wisdom, for, upon my word, it's the most
sensible word I've heard you utter for months past!"</p>

<p>And he goes; but before he goes he lays his hand upon the
sleek head and whispers:</p>

<p>"That's a good girl! Now be happy."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>They were married in Paris, very quietly, very happily. Lord
Charles came over from Scotland, leaving the grouse and the
salmon, to act as best man, and it was an open question which
of the two men looked happiest&mdash;he or the bridegroom. Lord
Charles had never heard of that forged note and his inadvertent
share in the plot that had worked so much harm, and he never
would hear of it; and furthermore he never quite understood
how it was that Stella Etheridge and not Lady Lenore became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
Leycester's wife; but he was quite satisfied and quite assured
that it was the best of all possible arrangements.</p>

<p>"Leycester's the happiest man in the world, and he used to be
the most wretched, and so there's an end of it," he declared,
whenever he spoke of the match. "And," he would add, "the
man who could have the moral cheek to be anything but absurdly
happy with such an angel as Lady Stella wouldn't be fit
to be anywhere out of a lunatic asylum."</p>

<p>They were married, and Charlie went back to the grouse, and
the painter went back to the cottage and Mrs. Penfold, leaving
the young couple to have their gay time of it in the gayest city
of the world. It was not particularly gay after all, but it was
ecstatically joyous. They went to the theaters and concerts and
enjoyed themselves like boy and girl, and Leycester found himself
continually amazed at the youthfulness which remained in
him.</p>

<p>"I have begun to live for the first time," he declared one day.
"I only existed before."</p>

<p>As for Stella, the days went by in a sort of ecstatic dream,
and only a little cloud lined the golden sky&mdash;the earl and countess
still hardened their hearts.</p>

<p>Though not a week passed without bringing a letter full of
love and longing from Lilian, the old people made no sign. In
the proud countess' eyes her son's wife was still Stella Etheridge,
the painter's niece, and she could not forgive her for&mdash;making
Leycester happy. It would have made Stella miserable if anything
could have done so, but Leycester's love and watchful care
often kept the cloud back&mdash;for a time.</p>

<p>They stayed in Paris until a little bijou place in Park Lane
was ready, then they went home and took quiet possession.</p>

<p>It was the most charming of little nests&mdash;Leycester had given
Jackson and Graham <i>carte blanche</i>&mdash;and formed a fitting casket
for the beautiful young viscountess.</p>

<p>"After all, Ley," she said, as she sat upon his knee on their
first evening and looked round her exquisite room, "it is almost
as good as the little laborer's cottage I used to picture for myself."</p>

<p>"Yes, it only needs that I should sit in my shirt sleeves and
smoke a long pipe, doesn't it?" he said, laughing.</p>

<p>For some weeks they did almost lead an isolated life; they were
always together, never tired or wearied of each other. Of Stella,
with her exquisite variety, with her ever changing mirth and
rare, delicate wit, it would certainly have been difficult for any
man to tire, and what woman would have wearied of the devoted
attention of such a man as Leycester! They lived quietly
for a little time, but as the season commenced people got scent
of them, and soon the world swooped down upon them.</p>

<p>Stella protested at first, but she was powerless to resist, and
soon the names of Lord and Lady Trevor appeared in the
fashionable lists. Then came a surprise. Like Lord Byron, she
woke one morning to find herself famous; the world had pronounced
her a beauty, and had elected her to one of its thrones.
Men almost fought for the honor of inserting their names upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
her ball-cards; women copied her dress, and envied her; the
photographers would have hung her portraits in their windows
if she had not been too wary to have one taken. She had become
a reigning queen. Leycester did not mind; he knew her too well
to be afraid that it would spoil her, and it amused him to find
that the world was rowing in the same boat with him&mdash;had gone
mad over his little Stella.</p>

<p>Now it was a gay time, but still the countess made no sign.
The Wyndwards were away on the continent in the winter, and
in the spring they went down to the Hall. Letters came from
Lilian regularly, and she grew more pathetic as time rolled on,
she was pining for Leycester. Stella urged him to sink his pride
and go down to the Hall, but he would not.</p>

<p>"Where I go I take my wife," he said, in his quiet way, and
Stella knew that it was useless to urge him.</p>

<p>But one day when it chanced that Stella was at home resting
after a grand ball at which she had reigned supreme, a brougham
drove up to the door, and while she was just preparing to say
"not at home," the servant opened the door of the boudoir, and
there stood the tall, graceful, lady-like figure of Lilian.</p>

<p>Stella sprang forward and caught her in her arms, with a cry
that brought Leycester bounding up-stairs.</p>

<p>The two girls clung to each other for at least five minutes,
crying softly, and uttering little piteous monosyllables, after the
manner of their kind; then Lilian turned to Leycester.</p>

<p>"Oh, Ley, don't be angry. I've come!" she cried.</p>

<p>"So I see, Lil," he said, kissing her. "And how glad we are
I need not say."</p>

<p>"And she shall never go again, shall she?" exclaimed Stella,
with her arm round the fragile form.</p>

<p>"Why, I don't mean to!" said Lilian, piteously. "You
won't send me away, will you, Stella? I can't live without him,
I can't indeed. You will let me stay, won't you? I shan't be in
the way. I'll creep into a corner, and efface myself; and I
shan't be very much trouble, because I am so much stronger
now, and&mdash;oh, you will let me stay?"</p>

<p>There is no need to set down in hard, cold, black letters their
answer.</p>

<p>"There is only one thing more I want to make my happiness
complete," said Stella; and they knew that she meant the reconciliation
of Leycester with the old people.</p>

<p>So Lilian stayed, and made an additional sunshine and joy in
the little house; and it amused Leycester to see how soon she too
fell at the feet of the new beauty and worshipped her.</p>

<p>"If any one could be too good for you, Ley," she said, "Stella
would be that one."</p>

<p>Well, time passed; the season was at its height, and the
countess came to town. The earl had been in his place in the
Upper House from the beginning of the season, of course; but
the countess had remained at the Hall nursing her disappointment.
She came up in time for one of the State balls, at which
her presence was indispensable. It was the great official ball of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
the season, and crowded to excess. The countess arrived with
the earl just before the small hours, and after the usual
ceremonies and exchanges of salutations with the great world
which she had left for so many months, she had time to look
round the room. She did so with a little inward tremor, for she
knew that Leycester and "his wife" were to be present. To her
relief&mdash;and disappointment&mdash;they had not arrived. For all her
pride and hauteur the mother's heart ached.</p>

<p>But if they were not there, their reputation had preceded
them. She heard Stella's name every five minutes, heard the
greatest in the land regretting her absence, and wondering what
kept her away.</p>

<p>Presently, toward two o'clock, there was a perceptible stir in
the magnificent salon, and the murmur went up:</p>

<p>"Lord and Lady Trevor!"</p>

<p>The countess turned pale for a moment, then looked toward
the door and saw a beautiful woman&mdash;or a girl still&mdash;entering,
leaning upon Leycester's arm. Society does for a man or
woman what a lapidary does for a precious stone. It was
precious when it first came into his hands, but when it leaves
them it is polished! Stella had become, if the word is allowable
when applied to her, the pink of refinement and delicacy,
"polished." She had learnt, unconsciously, to wear diamonds,
and that with princes. As she came in now, a crowd of "the
best" people came round her and did homage, and the countess,
looking on, saw with her own eyes, what she had heard rumored,
that this daughter-in-law of hers, this penniless niece, had
become a power in the land. It amazed her at first, but as she
watched she lost her wonder. It was only natural and reasonable;
there was no more beautiful or noble looking woman in the
room.</p>

<p>The band began to play a waltz, the crowds began to move,
dancing and promenading. The countess sat amongst the
dowagers, pale and smiling, but with an aching heart. Where
was Leycester? Presently four persons approached her. Charlie,
with Stella on his arm, Leycester with another lady. Suddenly,
not seeing her, Charlie stopped, and Stella turning, found herself
face to face with the countess.</p>

<p>For a moment the proud woman melted, then she hardened
her heart and turned her head aside.</p>

<p>Leycester, who been been watching, passed in front of her, and
he put his hand out.</p>

<p>"Leycester!"</p>

<p>But he drew Stella's arm within his&mdash;she was white and
trembling&mdash;and looking his mother in the face sternly, passed on
with Stella.</p>

<p>"Take me home, Leycester," she moaned. "Oh, take me
home! How can she be so cruel?"</p>

<p>But he would not.</p>

<p>"No," he said. "This is your place as much as hers. My poor
mother, I pity her. Oh, pride, pride! You must stay."</p>

<p>Of course the incident had been noticed and remarked, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
amongst the persons who had seen it was a prince of the
blood.</p>

<p>This distinguished individual was not only a prince but a gentle-hearted
man, and as princes can take things as they please,
he disregarded the best name on his ball programme and walking
straight up to Stella, begged with that grand humility which
distinguishes him, for the honor of her hand.</p>

<p>Stella, pale and beautifully pathetic in her trouble, faltered an
excuse, an excuse to a royal command.</p>

<p>But he would not take it.</p>

<p>"A few turns only, Lady Trevor, I implore. I will take care
of her, Leycester," he added in a murmur, and he led Stella away.</p>

<p>They took a few turns, then he stopped.</p>

<p>"You are tired," he said: "will you let me take you into the
cool?"</p>

<p>He drew her arm through his, but instead of "taking her into
the cool," as he phrased it, in his genial way, he marched straight
up to the countess.</p>

<p>"Lady Wyndward," he said; and his clear, musical voice was
just audible to those around, "your daughter has been too gracious
to her devoted adherents, and tired herself in the mazy
dance. I resign her to your maternal care."</p>

<p>Stella would have shrunk back, but the countess, who knew
what was due to royalty, rose and took the fair, round arm in
her matronly one.</p>

<p>"Come," she said, "his royal highness is right&mdash;you must
rest."</p>

<p>All in a dream, Stella allowed herself to be led into a shaded
recess, all fresh with ferns and exotica. Then she woke, and
murmuring&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thank you," was for flying; but the countess held out her
arms suddenly, and for the first time&mdash;well, for many years&mdash;burst
into tears, not noisy sobbing, but quiet, flooding tears.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear!" she murmured, brokenly. "Forgive me! I
am only a proud, wicked old woman!"</p>

<p>Stella was in her arms in an instant, and thus Leycester found
them.</p>

<p>When old Lady Longford heard of this scene, she was immensely
amused in her cynical way.</p>

<p>"It would have served you right my dear," she told
the countess, "if she had turned round and said, 'Yes, you are
a very wicked old woman,' and walked off."</p>

<p>So Stella's cup of happiness was full to the brim.</p>

<p>It is not empty yet, and will not be while Love stands with
upraised hand to replenish it.</p>

<p>She is a girl still, even now that there is a young Leycester to
run about the old man's studio and upset the pictures and add to
the litter, and it is the old painter's oft expressed opinion that
she will be a girl to the end of the chapter.</p>

<p>"Stella, you see," he is fond of remarking, whenever he hears
her sweet voice carolling about the little cottage&mdash;and it is as
often heard there as at the Hall&mdash;"Stella, you see, was born in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
Italy, and Italians&mdash;good Italians&mdash;never grow old. They manage
to keep a heart alive in their bosoms and laughter on their
lips at a period when people of colder climes are gloomy and
morosely composing their own epitaphs. There is one comfort
for you, Leycester, you have got a wife who will never grow
old."</p>
